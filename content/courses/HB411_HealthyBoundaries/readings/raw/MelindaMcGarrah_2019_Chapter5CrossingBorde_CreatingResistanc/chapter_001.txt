Could a wall be turningintoatable?GraceandRosalindacouldwondertogether. Are you part of the resistance? Resistance movements are revolutionary, purposefully transgressing dehumanizing borders of what is in order to co- participate in creating what can be. Resisting injustice remains unsatisfied with the status quo and dismantles obstacles and barriers in order to help create new life and deepen love. Resisting is about learning to live in mu- tualwonderandgenuineconcernwithaccountability,justice,andsharedjoy markedbysacredcelebration.Inthisbook,Ihavearguedthatpastoralcareas resisting injustice confronts embedded ways of also working against change when it comes to me, here, now, and what, or rather, who feels relevant to me, here, now. In this chapter, I raise a fifth form of resistance most often expressed by well-intentioned people who do want to change the world but feel like the work is just too far out of reach. Justice and joy, shared delight in wonder in beloved community matters for me, here, now, but just feels impossible.Onceconfrontedandtransformed,“notpossible”turnsintonew possibilities,crossingdehumanizingborderswithhealthyboundaries.Herein lies a challenge that can arrest the process before we even get started: given thatresistancemovementsaspastoralcarearebordercrossingpracticesand giventhatpastoralcareurgesdeveloping,maintaining,andrespectinghealthy boundaries, the postcolonializing practice of crossing borders with healthy boundariesraisesethicalchallengesandappropriateconcernthatneedcare- fulattentionhereandinfutureresearch.
