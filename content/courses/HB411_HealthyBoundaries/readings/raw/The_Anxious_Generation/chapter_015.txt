* A note about gender: Girls and boys use different platforms (on average) in different ways, and they experience different patterns of mental health and mental illness, so a substantial part of this book (particularly chapters 6 and 7) looks at trends and processes separately for girls and boys. It is noteworthy that an increasing number of Gen Z youth identify as non-binary. Several studies indicate that the mental health of non-binary youth is even worse than for their male and female peers (see Price-Feeney et al., 2020). Research on this group remains scarce, both historically and currently. I hope that future studies will explore how these technologies distinctly affect non-binary youth. Most of the research I present in this book applies to all adolescents. For example, the four foundational harms affect adolescents regardless of their gender identity. OceanofPDF.com
