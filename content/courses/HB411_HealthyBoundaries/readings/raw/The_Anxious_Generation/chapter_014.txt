* There is good evidence that the trends in overprotection, technology use, and mental health I describe happened in largely similar ways and at the same time in all of the countries of the Anglosphere: the United States, the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (see Rausch & Haidt, 2023, March). I believe they are happening in most or all of the developed Western nations, although with variations based on the degree of individualism, social integration, and other cultural variables. I am collecting studies from other parts of the world and will be writing about trends in those countries on the After Babel Substack. OceanofPDF.com
