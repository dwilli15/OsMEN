BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 8 Pew Research identifies 1997 as the first year of Gen Z, but I believe 1997 is a bit too late; the new behaviors were clear in college students arriving on campus in 2014 See Parker & Igielnik (2020). Jean Twenge chose 1995 as the first year of “iGen.” I split the difference between them and choose 1996 as the first year of Gen Z. Of course, generations are not separated by a bright line; nonetheless, they differ, as Twenge shows in her 2023 book, Generations. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 9 Of course, AI is looking like it will change everything, so we are likely to see a new generation beginning in the 2020s. But since AI is likely to pull children even farther away from the real world, my prediction is that it will lead to even higher levels of anxiety if we don’t act now to reverse the Great Rewiring of Childhood.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 20 There has been a general rise in suicides among adults (ages 50 and above) in the United States, Canada, the U.K., and Australia since 2010, but these changes are generally smaller than the changes among younger populations (in relative terms).

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 22 Chapter 1: The Surge of Suffering Names and minor details have been changed to protect privacy. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 1 The exception to this statement is suicide rates among American teens. Those rates generally declined in the early 2000s, hitting lows in 2007. The rates generally begin to rise in 2008, but they don’t rise above where they had been in the early 2000s until after 2010. I will discuss suicide rates in a later section. If we look further back in time, we see that rates of depression, anxiety, and other disorders have been rising among American adolescents since the 1950s, with fluctuations. But there is nothing like the “hockey stick” increases in the early 2010s, which you’ll see throughout this chapter and this book. See Twenge et al. (2010). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 2 Data through 2021: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2023). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 3 Research note on demographic variation: Since 2010, an escalating trend in adolescent mental illness is evident across all groups in the United States, whether we look by sex, race, sexual orientation, or social class. Overall, Black teenagers have long had lower rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide than their white counterparts, but both groups have seen a sharp increase since 2010, with larger absolute rises among white teens and larger relative (percentage) rises among Black teens (because they begin from a lower base rate). Data concerning social class is scarce, but depression follows similar trends across classes, with steep increases starting from 2010. Compared with heterosexual teens, LGBTQ teens report significantly higher rates in all the above measures. However, the evidence is inconclusive regarding the growth of self-harm and suicide rates among LGBTQ teens since 2010. For sources on these statistics and additional content, see the online supplement and see especially the link to Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010: A Collaborative Review. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 4 As part of that process, I created a “collaborative review document” with Jean Twenge in 2019. This was a publicly visible Google Doc where we collected all of the studies, surveys, and data sets we could find that shed light on how teen mental health had changed from the early 2000s to the present day in the United States and the U.K. We invited other researchers to add to the doc and critique it.

(The eating disorder anorexia nervosa is related to anxiety and is therefore classified as an internalizing disorder.)

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 13 The corresponding numbers for depression were 16% “always” or “most of the time,” 24% “about half the time,” and 60% “less than half the time” or “never.” BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 14 LeDoux (1996) showed that visual information takes two paths through the brain, one of which gets neural signals to the amygdala and hypothalamus nearly immediately, while information in the other path reaches the visual processing areas of the occipital cortex.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 23 Girls suffer more depression and make more suicide attempts, but they tend to use methods that are reversible, such as cutting their wrists or taking an overdose of sleeping pills.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 47 See the online supplement. Since 2010, suicide rates have been rising for Canadian adolescent girls, but not boys. For boys, this is a pattern I find in many countries: Depression and anxiety rates tend to go together, while suicide rates are somewhat more variable. For girls, anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide rates tend to go together. And among girls, suicide rates have been rising across the five Anglosphere countries. Note that suicide is complex and rare; it is influenced by many factors, such as the prevalence of guns in homes, the difficulty of getting emergency psychiatric care, and the level of social integration (as Émile Durkheim showed). It is by far the most serious mental health outcome, but it is not the most reliable indicator of the overall mental health of the population. See Rausch & Haidt (2023, October 30). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 48 See my review document, Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010: A Collaborative Review, which you can find linked from the online supplement. It includes dozens of studies on trends in the U.K. and the United States. See especially Cybulski et al. (2021). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 49 In the U.K., unlike the United States, the boys’ self-harm rate goes up by more than the girls’ rate in relative terms, although still much less in absolute terms. I should also note that suicide rates in England and Wales had been dropping overall since the 1980s and remained relatively steady through the early 2000s. Yet against that backdrop of decline, the overall suicide rate has been slowly rising since the 2010s, with a particularly rapid rise among teen boys and girls (along with adult males in their 50s and 60s). Note that the base rates for suicide among adolescents in England and Wales are much lower than in the United States. Once again, the relative increases for teen (15–19) girls are larger than for any other group. See Rausch & Haidt (2023, October 30). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 50 I re-graphed the data to put boys and girls in the same figure. You can find the graphs for the other age groups in the online supplement. Cybulski et al. (2021).

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 52 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2022). Although this dataset begins in 2007, other measures of mental health outcomes (e.g., self-reported psychological distress) show no rise in the early 2000s, and increases beginning around 2010. See online supplement for more. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 53 For Zach’s full analysis of mental health changes in the Nordic countries, see Rausch & Haidt (2023, April 19). High level of distress in figure 1.11 refers to those who reported suffering from at least three psychological ailments at least once a week over the last six months. The ailments were selected from a list of four ailments. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 54 There are only a few global surveys that examine adolescent mental health trends over time, with PISA and the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children Study (HBSC) being key sources. The HBSC, initiated in 1983, predominantly covers teens in Europe and North America. Using the HBSC, Cosma et al. (2020) found small declines in teenage mental well-being since 2002. However, this decrease was more pronounced in northern and western Europe and in Canada. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 55 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) (2002–2018).

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 59 Zach and I have been looking for alternate explanations for a long time. Is there anything else, besides the arrival of smartphones and social media, that could affect teens all around the world at the same time, such as a new chemical released widely around 2012? Or perhaps something that happened in the mid-1990s that affected babies in utero? We consider a few such possibilities in our review document, Alternative Hypotheses to the Adolescent Mental Illness Crisis: A Collaborative Review, www.anxiousgeneration.com/reviews.

But these cases are few and far between; cultural learning does not seem to be a major form of chimpanzee learning. See Tomasello (1994, pp. 301–317) for a review. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 4 This phrase is often attributed either to the great developmental psychologist Jean Piaget or to Maria Montessori, founder of an educational movement that immerses children in opportunities for free play. As far as I can tell, nobody can find a place where either person wrote that phrase, but it is in keeping with both of their philosophies.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 11 The wording of the item was changed in 2018, so later data is not available. The survey offered five response choices about how often students “get together with friends informally.” They ranged from “never” to “almost every day.” See further exploration in Twenge, Spitzberg & Campbell (2019). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 12 Research note: Throughout this book, I’ll present a series of graphs that Zach Rausch and I created from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey data (like figure 2.1). MTF surveys 8th, 10th, and 12th graders about many attitudes and behaviors every year. I will usually show graphs that take the average of all three grades, to give the most comprehensive picture of what is happening to American teens. I will almost always plot the data for boys and girls separately. While MTF began collecting 12th-grade data in 1976, the data gathering for 8th and 10th graders commenced only in 1991, and some variables were later introduced; for instance, weekly social networking usage was added in 2013. At times, I’ll show data exclusively from the 12th graders to extend our historical perspective back to the 1970s. I deliberately end most graphs in 2019, even though data is available through 2021, because the COVID pandemic made responses jump around in ways that often distract from the main message about what happened during the Great Rewiring (2010–2015). Also, sample sizes were much smaller in 2020 and 2021, making them less reliable. All graphs show data with the recommended weighting applied and grouped into two-year buckets (for example, data for 2018 and 2019 are averaged together). I do this because plotting every single year often produces a spikiness that obscures underlying trends. Merging pairs of years effectively smooths out the lines to reveal the trends. However, to be complete in my presentation of data, I also show versions of each graph in the online supplement—versions that plot every single year and that run through 2021. For graphs where I showed only 12th graders in the text, I give the graph with the three grades pooled in the supplement if data is available for the younger grades.

The brain continues to be malleable for life in the sense of forming new synapses, and there are some areas of the brain where new neurons continue to grow during adulthood. Adults continue to learn, and all learning involves some kind of brain change. But structural change is far more limited after areas have transformed during puberty.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 5 Although Twenge (2023b) showed that there was a smaller rise among millennials, which began a year or two after the surge among Gen Z. Furthermore, Gray et al. (2023) have argued that children’s independence has been decreasing since the 1940s, and that some measures of psychopathology have been increasing, slowly, since then too. I acknowledge this point, this backstory, but because rates were generally flat or even improving in the 1990s and early 2000s, I am focused on why there was a surge of mental illness that began in the early 2010s. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 6 The ability to process rapidly flashing images and written messages while multitasking on multiple screens was just not a selection pressure in human evolution, so it is not a skill that needs to be practiced in childhood.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 10 I obtained this clarification from Uri Bilmes, who had been trained as a rabbi: “It’s important to note that the age thresholds for adulthood were established in a different time and society. For reference, a famous passage in the rabbinic corpus lists different ages and their ideal corresponding stages of development in the following way: ‘Age five for Bible study, age 10 for Mishna study, age 13 for obligation in commandments, age 15 for Talmudic study, age 18 for marriage... ’ In the world of 13-year-old adulthood, marriage was not to be pushed off beyond 18. In today’s society, the consideration of a 7th grader as a ‘man’ (whose mom still packs his lunch) is almost an anachronism, maybe even humorous.” BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 11 Markstrom (2011, p. 157).

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 15 Of course the lines at 13 and 18 were blurry in practice. Kids could get into movies before 13 and into bars before 18 if they had a fake ID. But there was some risk involved—some actual fear when you handed your fake ID to the bartender or bouncer. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 16 Three items come from the Monitoring the Future data set: drinking alcohol: “Have you ever had beer, wine, or liquor to drink?”; work: “On the average over the school year, how many hours per week do you work in a paid or unpaid job?”; driver’s license: “Do you have a driver’s license?” The final item, sex, comes from the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey: “Have you ever had sexual intercourse?” BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 17 Rideout et al. (2022) reports that 18% of 8–12-year-olds are now daily users of social media, mostly Snapchat and Instagram. If we could limit this finding to 11- and 12-year-olds, it would be much higher. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 18 As Ron Lieber says in his excellent 2015 book, The Opposite of Spoiled, “Every conversation about money is also about values. Allowance is also about patience... work is about perseverance.” He also recommends that a weekly allowance begin “by first grade, at the latest,” which is roughly age 6. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 19 Personally I think the age for the first smartphone should be 16, but given where we are now, and given the importance of getting smartphones and social media entirely out of the lives of middle school students, I’m proposing that we make the transition to high school—around age 14—be the bright line that anchors a new norm.

And in 2019 alone, advertising accounted for 98% of Meta’s revenue, which was more than $69 billion. The same advertising-based business model powers TikTok, Snap, and most other major social media platforms. Their enormous revenues are a function of how well they cater to their customers—the advertisers—not the 3+ billion users. See Kemp (2019). That number increased to 4.9 billion in 2023; see Wong & Bottorff (2023). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 5 Lenhart (2015).

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 10 The numbers I report for total screen time come from Rideout & Robb (2019): around 5 hours a day of nonschool screen media for kids ages 8–12; 7–8 hours a day for older teens. Nagata, Ganson, et al. (2022) report findings consistent with those numbers: Children ages 9–10 were doing 4 hours of screen time a day before COVID. Nagata, Cortez, et al. (2022) report that 13-year-olds in the ABCD study were spending closer to 8 hours per day on screens in 2021. And the American College of Pediatricians (2020) found similar numbers: about 5 hours per day for 8–12-year-olds; nearly 7.5 hours for teens. All of these studies exclude screen use for school or homework; all are just leisure use, so I report this as around 40 hours per week for tweens and more than 50 hours per week for teens. Similar numbers are found in the U.K.: Hiley, C. (2022, September 13). Screen time report 2022. Uswitch. www.uswitch.com/mobiles/screentime-report. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 11 Twenge, Martin & Spitzberg (2019), analyzing data from Monitoring the Future. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 12 There is less data on technology use trends among Asian Americans. The results are contradictory, with some studies reporting lower screen time compared with white, Black, and Latino teens (see Nagata, Ganson, et al., 2022; Nagata et al. 2023), while others show that screen time use is comparable to Black and Hispanic teens (see Rideout et al., 2011). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 13 Research note: In previous decades, the digital divide has resulted in socioeconomic disparities, with wealthier families having quicker adoption and greater access to technology such as computers, laptops, and televisions. Although the digital divide still exists, it often plays out in unexpected ways in the United States. For example, despite 57% of U.S. adults with an income less than $30,000 having high-speed broadband, compared with 83% of those earning between $30,000 and $100,000, lower-income families increasingly rely on smartphones for internet, leading to heavier smartphone usage. Notably, smartphone ownership among tweens (8-to-12-year-olds) and teens (13-to-18-year-olds) doesn’t vary significantly across social classes, though time spent on screens does. Tweens from lower-income families (who make less than $35,000 a year) spend about three hours more per day on screens than their wealthier peers, while lower-income teens spend about two hours more. Moreover, many tech executives, including those from Silicon Valley, send their children to private schools like the Waldorf School of the Peninsula where screen use is prohibited. This is in contrast with many public schools that are advancing 1:1 technology programs, trying to give every child their own device. Additionally, many lower-income parents work multiple jobs, and they are more likely to raise a child in a single-parent household, leaving less time and energy to invest in monitoring the quantity and content of their child’s screen use. The socioeconomic variation in screen use has been found in other countries too; see, for example, Pedersen (2022) in Denmark. Regarding race, Black and Hispanic youths are more likely to own a smartphone than their white counterparts. Black tweens spend about two more hours per day on screen time than white tweens do. Latino tweens have an even larger gap, spending about two and a half hours more than white tweens do. LGBTQ teens also report spending about three hours more time per day on screens than their cis heterosexual counterparts. For sources, see Vogels (2021); Rideout et al.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 37 There are many studies on this topic. To add some international evidence: a large study (Khan et al., 2023) analyzed the results of a survey given to teens in 38 countries and found that heavy users of all digital media had more sleep problems than did light users, with effects kicking in above two hours a day for each media type, and accelerating above four hours per day (again suggesting that addiction contributes to these effects). The effects were generally larger for girls. I should note that the effects for “passive screen time,” which was mostly TV and videos, did not appear until daily average time was above four hours. This is a consistent finding: TV, which is passive, is not as bad as social media or video games, which involve rapid behaviors that get reinforced with rewards, and hence are more addictive.

See Uhls et al. (2017) for a review of the benefits. They refer to many studies before 2012 and include sources that focus on internet use, such as Borca et al. (2015).

See also Brailovskaia, Krasavtseva, et al. (2022), who looked only at women in Russia. They found that “problematic social media use significantly mediated the relationship between daily stress and suicide-related outcomes,” but this was true only for younger women (below age 29), not for older women.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 3 Research note: The graphs in this chapter are mostly about American teens because there is excellent data on them going back in some studies to the 1970s, particularly the Monitoring the Future study. I am confident that these trends are similar in the other Anglosphere countries. I believe—from some large international studies and from what people write to me—that these trends are happening in much of Europe and Latin America. I know little about trends in Asia or Africa, although the isolating, loneliness-inducing effects of rapid technological change on social relationships may be muted in more collectivist, religious, and family-oriented societies.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 5 Twenge, Haidt, et al. (2022). We reanalyzed the same data sets used by Orben & Przybylski (2019), and we addressed a few other problems we saw in that study, such as controlling for psychological variables that are related to mental health, rather than just controlling for demographic variables, as is usually done. We found correlations between social media use and mental health equivalent to r = 0.20, which is in the ballpark of binge drinking, not eating potatoes, in those data sets. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 6 There has been a surprising convergence in recent years around the size of the correlation between social media use and internalizing disorders (especially anxiety and depression). Jean Twenge and I have found it to be around r = 0.20 when you limit the analysis to girls and social media (where r is the “Pearson correlation coefficient” that runs from r = -1.0 for a perfect negative correlation, through r = 0 for a complete absence of correlation, to r = 1.0 for a perfect positive correlation). Orben & Przybylski (2019) said that the correlation was equivalent to r < 0.04, which truly would be negligible, but again, that was for all digital activities and all teens. When Amy Orben (2020) reviewed many other studies that were limited to social media (rather than all digital media), she found that the associations with well-being range from r = 0.10 to r = 0.15, and that was for boys and girls combined. The effects are usually larger for girls, so that puts it up above r = 0.15 for the link between social media and poor mental health for girls, which is very close to what Twenge and I have found. Jeff Hancock, another major researcher who has been skeptical of the claim that social media harms teen mental health, conducted a meta-analysis of studies through 2018 (Hancock et al., 2022). He and his coauthors found that time on social media was not substantially associated with most well-being variables, with the exception of depression and anxiety. For those outcomes the correlations were, once again, between r = 0.10 and r = 0.15, and that, again, is for boys and girls merged. So the research community is closing in on a consensus that crude measures of social media use are correlated with crude measures of anxiety and depression, for girls, at a level around or above r = 0.15. (If measurement of the two variables was better, the correlations would be higher.) Is r = 0.15 tiny? Not in public health (see Götz et al., 2022). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 7 I note that in Twenge, Haidt, et al (2022) and other studies, “internet use” often shows similarly high correlations with poor mental health, for girls in particular. I also note that some studies find moderator variables—that is, variables that make some girls more or less prone to harm from social media. Some that have been found include early puberty, high media consumption, and preexisting depression or anxiety. See section 2 of Social Media and Mental Health: A Collaborative Review. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 8 See a review of these studies in my Substack post: Social Media Is a Major Cause of the Mental Illness Epidemic in Teen Girls. Here’s the Evidence (Haidt, 2023, February 23).

But many studies establish that heavy social media use causes depression, and some of the longitudinal studies establish that increasing social media use at Time 1 predicts greater depression at Time 2.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 14 In the Social Media and Mental Health collaborative review document that Jean Twenge, Zach Rausch, and I curate, we collect the abstracts of hundreds of studies on social media, organized by whether they find evidence of harm or not. As I write, in 2023, we have 20 RCT studies in the document, of which 14 (70%) found evidence of harm. Of the 6 experiments that did not find evidence of harm, it is noteworthy that 4 of them asked participants to give up social media for a short time period—one week or less. I believe we should not expect benefits from making addicts give up their drug for a short time. They need at least three weeks for their brains to reset and get past withdrawal cravings. Of the 14 that found an effect, only 2 used a time interval of one week or less. So if we eliminate the 6 studies that used short durations, we are left with a ratio of 12 to 2, or 86% that found a significant effect.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 22 I note that several prominent researchers disagree with me on these points. They don’t assert that social media is harmless, but they believe that the accumulated scientific evidence is not yet sufficient to prove that social media causes anxiety, depression, and other negative psychological outcomes.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 63 The DSM-5 estimates that the 12-month prevalence of DID among U.S. adults is 1.5% (American Psychiatric Association, 2022, March). However, the population estimates are still debated, with studies showing variation, though generally falling between 1% to 1.5% of the U.S. population. See Dorahy et al. (2014); Mitra & Jain (2023). Part of the reason for the range (which is sometimes reported as being higher than 1.5%) is that psychiatrists have long debated whether or not it is a real disorder. Some believe that it is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder, a reaction to trauma so severe that the mind forms multiple identities to cope. Others believe that the emergence of DID relies heavily on suggestion and a predisposition to fantasy and suggestibility, which may occur in the wake of real trauma.

Each chapter explores elements of male psychology that seem to have been adaptive for some extended period of human evolution—a time when most males never got a chance to mate, so competition among males was intense, and violence sometimes “paid,” in evolutionary terms, if it led to even a single act of copulation. Buss says repeatedly that the evolutionary frame in no way condones sexual aggression or implies that change is impossible. Instead, evolutionary psychology can help us understand why sexual aggression is far more common among males and how we can effectively reduce it. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 74 Culture and socialization can discourage the use of such tactics and shame men who use them; indeed, the feminist movement from the 1970s through #MeToo has brought about such changes. And yet, as society fragments into millions of online communities, some of those communities put men into competition for prestige by espousing more and more extreme attitudes, making those tactics seem permissible again.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 28 There is a unique exception to the principle that the virtual world pulls boys away from risk in the real world: Social media sometimes incentivizes boys to put themselves and others in danger in order to gain prestige on social media. For instance, viral TikTok challenges often involve dangerous stunts, such as the “Cha Cha Slide” challenge: Participants mimic the song’s dance commands while driving, swerving erratically into oncoming traffic. In the “Skull Breaker” challenge, unsuspecting adolescents are tricked into jumping up while their feet are kicked out from under them, leading to severe head injuries and even death. The “Devious Licks” challenge encourages adolescents to live stream themselves vandalizing their school bathrooms. Among the most deadly challenges so far is the “Blackout” challenge, where participants set up a phone to film themselves while they use a rope or other household item to strangle themselves until they fall unconscious. Afterward, they post the video of their blackout and reawakening, for those who do reawaken. In an 18-month span between 2021 and 2022, a Bloomberg Businessweek report found that at least 15 children below the age of 12, along with others who were older, had died from this single challenge: Carville, O.

Porn is just as popular with boys who are not heterosexual, although the effects on their sexual development may be different. See Bőthe et al. (2019) for a review of the literature on LGBTQ adolescents and porn, including this line: “LGBTQ adolescents’ pornography use does not appear to be related to more negative outcomes compared with heterosexual adolescents; thus, LGBTQ adolescents do not seem more vulnerable to pornographic materials than heterosexual adolescents.” BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 33 Ogas & Gaddam (2011).

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 61 Chris Ferguson, author of Moral Combat, who has been studying the effects of video games on mental health for decades, notes that part of the problem with determining prevalence is that “there is no agreed upon set of symptoms for problematic gaming, nor any single measure of it, so prevalence estimates are all over the place.” BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 62 See Männikkö et al. (2020) for evidence on the effects of problematic gaming on mental health. See also Brailovskaia, Meier-Faust, et al. (2022), who found in an experiment that a two-week period of abstinence from video games reduced stress, anxiety, and other symptoms of internet gaming disorder in a sample of German adults who spent at least three hours per week gaming before the study. Also see Ferguson, Coulson & Barnett (2011), who argue that the evidence between time spent gaming and mental health outcomes is highly varied and may be rooted in underlying mental health problems. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 63 Rideout & Robb (2019). Similar results were found in a study of Norwegian adolescents (Brunborg et al., 2013), where the mean time spent gaming per week for girls was 5 hours, and for boys it was 15 hours and 42 minutes. For the addicted gamers, the mean time spent gaming per week was 24 hours. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 64 Girls also play video games, but at much lower rates, for less time, with different games, and with less enjoyment, on average, than boys. The 2019 Common Sense report found that 70% of 8-to-18-year-old boys enjoy console gaming “a lot” compared with 23% of girls (Rideout & Robb, 2019). The rates rise for mobile gaming, with 35% of girls reporting high enjoyment compared with 48% of boys. The report also shows that girls spend about 47 minutes per day gaming, with most of that time on their smartphones. Girls, on average, also tend to play different genres of games from boys, with greater interest in social, puzzle/card, music/dance, educational/edutainment, and simulation games (see Phan et al., 2012; also see Lucas & Sherry, 2004; Lang et al., 2021). And in recent years, there has been an explosive rise in the popularity of female video game streamers, who amass large (mostly male) followings. See Patterson, C. (2023, January 4).

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 34 Brussoni et al. (2017). BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 35 Healthy play is not entirely painless. Roughhousing, name-calling, scrapes, and bruises are all parts of natural play, and they are necessary for the antifragility effects of play to take hold. Removing them from recess to keep kids “safe” is like removing all the nutrients from wheat and feeding kids only white bread. I’m not saying that we should ever accept bullying. Bullying by most definitions requires a repeated pattern, over more than one day, of one child intending to harm another. There is an essential role for adults in setting up policies to reduce bullying, and in responding to it when it happens. But the vast majority of conflicts and cases of teasing and name-calling are not bullying, and adults should not rush in to stop them. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 36 Dee (2006); Mullola et al. (2012).

Get phones out of schools now. Atlantic. www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/ban-smartphones-phone-free-schools-social-media/674304. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 40 I recognize that schools may face increased liability risks and insurance costs. I hope that governments can pass liability reforms that would free schools to focus on education rather than lawsuits. See Howard (2014) for a discussion of how this can be done. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 41 This would rectify one of the biggest shortcomings in the scientific literature: the focus on individual-level effects because there is almost no research on entire schools that went phone-free or that greatly expanded free play and autonomy. Let’s measure the emergent group-level effects of these policies. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 42 If the number of schools is very large, then random assignment would work well. If there are only 16 middle schools, let’s say, and if they vary by race or social class, then it would be wise to separate similar schools to be sure that each of the four groups is as comparable to the others as possible. Once the groups are created, the assignment of each group to an experimental condition could be done using a random method such as drawing numbers from a hat. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 43 Before the experiment begins, a set of agreed-upon measures are collected, or created if they don’t exist, to measure the key variables that the school cares about, such as academic achievement, mental health referrals, student reports of their mental health and their engagement with school, measures of bullying and behavioral problems, and teacher reports about classroom culture including students’ ability to stay on task and engage with the lesson. The measures would be collected every month, if possible, or at least three times during the school year. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 44 In elementary schools, where phones may not yet be much of a problem, a district might want to try simpler versions of the experiment with just two conditions: Play Club versus no Play Club, or Let Grow Project versus no Let Grow Project. Experiments like these should be tried in different regions and countries to see how well they work in varied conditions.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 13 Be sure the camp truly locks up phones for the duration; many camps say that they ban phones, but like many schools they really just mean “Don’t let an adult see you taking your phone out of your pocket.” BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 14 See this profile of playborhoods: Thernstrom, M.

Also see Lanza’s book and website at www.playborhood.com. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 15 Some parents are concerned that they may be liable if someone else’s child gets hurt. The fear of lawsuits can be paralyzing. But Lanza says he decided against waivers or getting extra insurance. Instead, he removed any obvious dangers from his yard, added some play equipment—he recommends things like swings, a playhouse, some area to make art—and trusted his neighbors not to sue him. It worked. Kids there are getting a taste of a play-based childhood. A no-cost and lower liability risk option is to have parents rotate responsibility for being present at a local park or playground each afternoon, so that families know that there will be an adult on hand who will only get involved in case of emergencies.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 17 Children in this age range are noticing and copying adult behavior; therefore, it is important to model healthy technology use. You don’t have to be perfect, but do try to show your children how to set healthy boundaries so that they see you making an effort to keep screens in their proper place, and to be fully present when it is time to be fully present.

BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 1 Middle schools should see substantial improvements within two years, given that these four reforms would all make daily life more playful and sociable, and less phone-based. In high schools, it will be hard for parents to get students off social media when they are already on. High schools are likely to see some immediate benefits from going phone free. But the biggest improvements might not be seen until several years of new students have entered the high school from middle schools and families that had delayed the phone-based childhood until high school. BACK TO NOTE REFERENCE 2 Latane & Darley (1968). There was a third condition, in which the real subject was in the waiting room with two other students who were working for the experimenters. Their job was to just sit there and keep filling out their questionnaires. In that condition, only 10% of the students got up to report the smoke. This is the finding usually presented in discussions of this study, but I think the condition with three real subjects is the most important one.
