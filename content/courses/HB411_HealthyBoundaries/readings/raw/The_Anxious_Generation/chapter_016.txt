* I wrote the technology sections of this chapter with assistance from my friend and longtime research collaborator Ravi Iyer, who was a product manager, data scientist, and research manager at Facebook (now Meta) for four years, before leaving to work on technology reform at the University of Southern California Marshall School’s Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision Making. I also drew on advice from members of two nonprofit tech reform organizations in which I am a participant: Project Liberty, and the Council for Responsible Social Media. I wrote the “real world” sections of this chapter with assistance from Lenore Skenazy. OceanofPDF.com
