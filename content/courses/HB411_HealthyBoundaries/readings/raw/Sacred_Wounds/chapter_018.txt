THROUGH THE LOOkING GLASS 73 thought as it passes. Watch it without judgment or criticism, and without blame of self or others. 8. Let each thought pass one at a time, carried by the gentle breeze across the landscape of your mind. 9. Whenever you feel overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings, you can close your eyes and watch those thoughts until the process becomes slower and less chaotic. If you can’t close your eyes, look up to the sky and observe the physical clouds and practice thought watching using that natural landscape. Continue this practice regularly. Build up to 10 minutes of practice at a time. You can then build beyond 10 minutes up to 20 minutes. The ultimate goal of most meditative or mindful practices is to reach a maximum of about 20 minutes. Don’t let this frighten you—in the beginning it may be 1 minute or 5 minutes, but keep working on it. It will decrease stress and increase your ability to have control over your thoughts and your mind.
