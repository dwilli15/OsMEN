Preface My life before I had healthy boundaries was overwhelming and chaotic. I, too, have struggled with codependency, peace in life and at work, and unfulfilling relationships. But setting expectations for myself and others gives me peace. Inventing a life with healthy relationships is an ongoing practice, but it gets more comfortable with time and practice. The moment that I let up on setting perimeters, my old problems resurface. Because of this, I’ve made healthy boundaries a part of my life practice. Consistently, I am practicing assertiveness and self-discipline to create the life that I want. In the past, I carried around a lot of resentment, hoping that others would guess my mood and wishes. Through trial and error, I’ve learned that people will not guess my needs. They went about their day while I suffered in silence. The things that I once found hard to say, such as “I won’t be able to help you move,” now come out more firmly. I was scared, I didn’t want to make anyone mad, and I didn’t know the right words. I feared that standing up for myself would cost me my relationships. All the while, the personal cost was much higher. When I first learned about boundaries, I was confused about how the concept applied to my life. “Boundaries” can be such a broad and intimidating term. This book will break down the many aspects of having healthy boundaries and offer insights into how we can honor the boundaries set by others. It took me years to not feel as guilty setting limits with others, because I didn’t know that guilt was normal when you’re doing something that you believe to be mean. This book will teach you how to manage the discomfort (guilt) that stops you from having the life that you want. Hopefully, it will give you the confidence and courage to create healthy boundaries in your own life.
