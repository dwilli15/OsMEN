ACKNOWLEDGMENTS For a number of years, I used a variety of instruments for assessing an individual’s usual or preferred conflict styles. None of these was fully satisfactory. So, drawing on the learning and the concepts from those who have gone before me, I developed another tool for helping people look at their conflict behavior. I am indebted to the writers of two conflict instruments that I have used extensively and from which I have drawn many of the ideas that are contained herein: Conflict Management Survey, by Jay Hall, published by Teleometrics Int’l., P.O. Box 314, The Woodlands, TX 77380. Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, by Kenneth W. Thomas and Ralph H. Kilmann, published by XICOM, Sterling Forest, Tuxedo, NY 10987.
