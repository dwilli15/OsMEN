Conclusion Once you have completed the questionnaire in this booklet, scored your answers, and reviewed the explanations of the scoring, you should have a vocabulary to help you describe your experience in conflict settings. You should not assume that you have a deep insight into your personality. This instrument is not intended to provide such information. It is a guide to reflection on your own perceptions of your behavior and a guide to reflecting on other options you might want to use in future conflicts when they, inevitably, arise.
