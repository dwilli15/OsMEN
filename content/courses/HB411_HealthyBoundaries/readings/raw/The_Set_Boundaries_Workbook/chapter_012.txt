9 Holding Your Boundaries Is a Form of Self-Care Self-care is a restorative mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical practice that rejuvenates, relaxes, and enhances your life. It’s personal—therefore, how you practice self-care may look different from the way someone else practices it. Although self-care is used in response to feeling overwhelmed or depleted, it’s also a preventative practice. What things do you do on a daily basis to take care of yourself? What are some of your thoughts and beliefs about taking care of yourself? What gets in the way of you taking better care of yourself? What boundaries do you need to set for yourself and others to have more time for self-care? Leaning into Yourself The most reported problem with practicing self-care is the inability to find time for it. In this exercise, consider the time you spend doing the following activities in one day and over one week. ACTIVITY TIME PER DAY TIME PER WEEK Watching TV Using social media Doing household work Going to work/school Playing video games Sleeping Caring for others Dating/spending time with a partner Engaging in a hobby Spending time with others Spending time alone Doing things you enjoy Doing things you don’t enjoy Others are engaged in self-nurturing practices all around you. I see my friends caring for themselves in the following ways: I see my partner practicing self-care in the following ways: I saw my parents/caregivers caring for themselves in the following ways: When people don’t care for themselves, I’ve noticed the following consequences: In what ways can you better care for yourself in the following areas? Physical: __________________________________________ Spiritual: __________________________________________ Mental: __________________________________________ Emotional: __________________________________________ Personal Boundaries It’s healthy to have limits with yourself. Some of us don’t like being told what to do by others, so we’re challenged by setting rules for ourselves. You can’t do whatever you want because doing so could damage your health, relationships, and goals. PERSONAL BOUNDARY ASSESSMENT Let’s go deeper with the following exercise. For each statement, identify if you have healthy boundaries in the specified area. HEALTHY Finances Self-care Physical care Mental health Spiritual care Relationships UNHEALTHY Finances Self-care Physical care Mental health Spiritual care Relationships Self-Boundaries Are Self-Discipline An essential part of setting boundaries involves honoring the limits you’ve set with others and yourself. Practicing boundaries is an act of shifting your habits. The next time you become upset when someone dishonors your boundary, consider how challenging it is to discipline yourself to always uphold your boundaries. My biggest challenge with honoring limitations that I set for myself is: I violate the boundaries I set for myself in the following ways: When I dishonor my boundaries, I can tell myself: Forcing People to Honor Your Needs Isn’t Possible Healthy boundaries are about are you, not other people. You can choose how you want to show up, but you cannot make (force or demand that) others be anything except who they want to be. Essentially, you are making requests of others that they have the choice to honor or not. Controlling others, particularly when their behaviors have nothing to do with you, is not healthy. Just as you have expectations, other people can have expectations for themselves. Just as you are entitled to live your life, other people are entitled to live theirs. Sometimes, what you want collides with what the other person wants. In these cases, you have choices: Which need is healthiest? Can you compromise? And if you can’t resolve it on your own, consider consulting a therapist. A healthy boundary sounds like “I am going to take a break from dating.” Control sounds like “You need to stop dating because you are terrible at picking people.” Boundaries are not ways to control other people. When People Won’t Honor Your Boundaries After you determine that certain people cannot or will not honor your boundary, the next course of action is to change your behavior in the relationship. I’ve set the following boundary ______________ with ______________, and they refuse to honor my boundary. Since they have shown that they cannot/will not honor my boundary, I will ______________. Consequences Consequences are not punitive; they’re a way to protect yourself and enforce your boundaries with others. Allowing people to violate a limit repeatedly without effect is a way that you dishonor your own boundaries. In the following scenarios, consider a consequence for the boundary violation: 1. You’ve asked your friend to stop bringing up your ex because you’re trying to move on. What is the consequence for their refusal to adhere to this boundary? 2. Your brother borrowed $500 for his rent. He’s always late paying you back, so this time you stressed the importance of returning the money on time. Nevertheless, he’s late again. What is the consequence for his refusal to adhere to this boundary? 3. You’ve asked your in-laws to respect your dietary choices for your kids. Yet they continue giving the children foods on your no-no list. What is the consequence for their refusal to adhere to this boundary? Pause: Sometimes, doing your part is the hardest part. Admitting that you’re the person standing in your own way can be difficult and yet also freeing. Take a moment to admire how powerful you are. Important Reminder: Sometimes it’s best to leave before you reach your breaking point. It’s okay to pivot without suffering for a prolonged period. Staying until you can’t take any more takes a lot out of you. Enough can be enough, at your discretion. Accepting Boundaries from Others As you become more comfortable with placing boundaries, you may notice that you sometimes violate boundaries that others have set with you. There’s no denying that it feels personal when someone sets limitations with you. You may have experienced someone asking for space in a relationship, asking you to be on time, or making other requests based on their needs and expectations. As you’ve learned throughout this book, implementing boundaries isn’t easy or effortless, so when someone places a boundary with you, know that they probably thought about it a lot (even if their delivery wasn’t the best). When ______________ placed the following boundary with me ______________, I felt [use one word to describe your feelings] ______________. It’s true that being on the receiving end of boundaries isn’t always easy, but it’s an important way to honor the needs of others. Make a list of ways to care for yourself when boundaries are placed with you. How Culture Impacts the Ability to Set and Stick to Boundaries My very first client was from an enmeshed family. My client wanted to be more autonomous, but in his culture, along with his mother, his older sister acted like a mother figure and took care of him. Unfortunately, this behavior blurred the lines between having siblings and having parents. He had to answer not only to his parents but also to his sister. Sometimes, cultural norms can get in the way of establishing an identity for yourself. By developing your boundaries, you can become the person you want to be despite these norms. In some cultures, boundary violations such as enmeshment are not seen as such because they’re the norm. They become boundary violations when one person wants something different. In Black culture, it’s widely accepted that you cannot talk back to adults. For myself and many of my peers, this cultural norm has left little room for individuality, openness, and comfort in our relationships with our elders. Culture can be religious, geographical, ethnic, race-related, or environmental. How has your culture of origin impacted your boundaries? What boundaries do you have or want to have that are outside your culture’s norms? Gather Yourself This chapter was about doing your part to honor yourself.
