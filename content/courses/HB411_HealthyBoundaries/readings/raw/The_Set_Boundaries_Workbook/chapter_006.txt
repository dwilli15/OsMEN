3 Learning to Set Boundaries Many of us are born aware of our needs. You knew when you were hungry or wet, or when you wanted to be comforted. Early on, you had no issues saying no and asking for what you needed. Somewhere along the way, we learn to quiet our desires for the comfort of others. This silencing creates adults who find it challenging to advocate for themselves. Someone may have told you, “It’s not nice to do that,” or ignored your needs. In my book Set Boundaries, Find Peace, I wanted to help people get back to the root of who they were/are as boundaried individuals. You’ve been talked out of being assertive because it didn’t please others. Reclaiming your voice is the key to setting boundaries. JOURNAL PROMPT What were some of the boundaries in your home? Example: We were allowed to eat in the dining room only on holidays. What boundaries do you think would’ve been helpful? Did you feel safe setting boundaries in your family? Be Clear and Make It Plain Sometimes when people talk extensively about problems, boundaries become confusing. Nowhere in their lengthy description do they state a need or make a request. Therefore, when placing boundaries, it’s important to get right down to what you want, need, and expect. Using more words doesn’t make your boundary more valid, and providing lengthy explanations can give others ammunition to challenge your boundaries. Three-Step Process 1. Keep it short. This is especially important if you’re new to voicing your expectations. When you’re a newbie, people can talk you out of your boundaries because of your lack of confidence. So keep your statements down to one or two sentences. 2. Be clear. Do your best to be as straightforward as possible. Mind your tone—don’t yell or whisper. People will miss the boundary if you use complicated words or jargon. Take a deep, deep breath, and focus on being precise. 3. Directly state your need or request, or say no. Don’t just mention what you don’t like; ask for what you need or want. Identify your expectations, or decline the offer. Use a starter: Short version (beginners): I want/need/expect ______________. Long version (more experienced): I want ______________ because ______________. I need ______________ because ______________. I expect ______________ because ______________. Note: When using the long version, consider how you’ll respond if they challenge your boundary. Dealing with the discomfort that happens as a result of setting boundaries is the hardest part. Discomfort is the number one reason we bypass setting them. But it’s common afterward to feel guilty, afraid, sad, remorseful, or awkward. Examples: A friend asks you to help them move, but you don’t want to. You say, “I’m not able to help you move.” You’re tired of hearing your friend complain about their partner. You say, “I want to be here for you, but I’m not able to help you. Have you considered a couples therapist?” Try a few on your own: A coworker is gossiping to you about another coworker, and you don’t want to be involved. You need help with planning your birthday party and want your sister to help. Pause: When you’re feeling emotionally unable to move through the book, step outside for some fresh air. Two Parts to Setting a Boundary: Verbal Communication and Action It has always been assumed that boundaries are what we say to people, but boundaries are also what you do. Examples of verbal boundaries: “I’m not able to commit to another project at this time.” “I don’t feel comfortable sharing something that isn’t my business to share.” Examples of actions: Not committing to more when you don’t have the time to commit. Not sharing anything when you feel uncomfortable doing so. CHECKLIST Have you ever experienced any of the following when you’ve set a boundary with someone? Pushback: They ignore that you mentioned a boundary and continue to do what they want. Testing limits: They try to sneak, manipulate, or get one past you. They attempt to do what they want but in a way you might not notice. Rationalizing and questioning: They challenge the reason for your boundary and its validity. Defensiveness: They challenge what you said or your character, or they make excuses about how their behavior is okay.
