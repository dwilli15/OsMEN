Author’s Note “Is therapy for everyone?” We may not all have access to therapy, or the resources or the desire to go, but we can all benefit from the insights discovered through therapy. In 2017, when I started using Instagram to share information about relationships, mental health, and healthy living, I did so to make the tools for healing and for growing more accessible. Like therapy itself, therapeutic tools can also be helpful. This book is such a tool, and you can use it on your own or in conjunction with a licensed professional. At any time while reading this book, if the content feels too heavy, please pause. If you can’t shake the heaviness, take it as a sign to seek therapy, as you may need more support.
