10 All in the Family When you want to set boundaries, family relationships are often the most challenging. Since your family knew you before you had a good understanding of yourself, your family’s perception of you, as well as your perception of yourself, is partly based on ancient history. It can be scary to make changes to become more of who you really are. It’s natural to fear how others may react to the “real” you. How do you believe that you are perceived by your family of origin? For example, “My family believes that I have it all together because I rarely ask for support.” What do you wish they knew about you? Three Possible Reasons You May Find It Hard to Set Boundaries with Family 1. You have no clue where to start. For your entire life, you’ve lived with certain dynamics, and now that you’re ready to change them, you aren’t sure how to go about it. 2. You feel certain that your family will reject your boundaries. Sometimes, setting boundaries comes at the expense of further damaging unhealthy relationships. 3. You feel like you’re betraying your family’s values. Breaking away from the cultural norms in your family can feel like you’re betraying them. But doing something for yourself is not against your family. PARENTS JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND The items below suggest that you need healthier boundaries with your parents. Mark off all areas that apply to you, and use the blank spaces to write some of your own specific examples. They are aware of intimate details of your romantic relationship (particularly if your parents are causing harm in the relationship). You feel pressured to act in a certain way to please them. They are involved in disputes you have with others. They don’t respect your opinion. They enter your personal space without asking. They insist you say yes to everything. You say yes to them out of obligation, even when it’s inconvenient. __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ Knowing Your Needs Sometimes you might be unaware of what boundaries are needed and which boundaries you already have in place. For each of the following relationships, share a boundary that you have and one that you need. I have the following boundaries with my mother: I need the following boundaries with my mother: I have the following boundaries with my father: I need the following boundaries with my father: I have the following boundaries with my ______________: I need the following boundaries with my ______________: Healthy Limits with Your Adult Children Parenting is a lifetime job, but your role evolves from being 100 percent hands-on to being someone who plays a supportive role. When children become adults, parents need to transition to a new role. The items below suggest that you need healthier boundaries with your adult child. Mark off all that apply to you. You help them make decisions in most areas of their lives. They are unable to care for themselves without your financial support. They lack key life skills, and you pick up the slack. They intrude on your time and space. They manipulate you into doing things for them. You feel taken advantage of in the relationship. An important part of parenting adult children is providing them with resources, supporting them, and allowing them to create their own life. I have the following boundaries with my adult children: I need the following boundaries with my adult children: Healthy Limits with Children Under Eighteen Children benefit when parents have expectations of them. Clear and reasonable limitations help them feel loved and keep them safe. Although kids can be allotted some autonomy in their lives, it’s essential to continue monitoring them and providing structure. The items below suggest that you need healthier boundaries with your child. Mark off all areas that apply to you. They have no rules. Your parenting style is permissive. Your children are used as confidants. Your parenting style is punitive only. They are allowed to speak to others inappropriately. I have the following boundaries with my children: I need the following boundaries with my children: Before I became a therapist, I was a juvenile probation officer. In my role, I serviced kids who were in placement (jail) and those in the community. When kids were sent to placement, I saw the majority of them change from criminals to teenagers. Much of the job with juveniles is centered on working with their families. Many of the children I served came from family environments with porous boundaries. The children didn’t have structure, and being sent to placement gave them structure. Their schoolwork improved to grade level, they completed GED programs, and they improved their social skills. Children need healthy boundaries in the home to be healthy people. They are not capable of managing themselves. Write a letter to your younger self describing how different boundaries would’ve been helpful, or how the ones you had hurt or harmed you. Healthy Limits with In-Laws Issues with in-laws are often the result of poorly defined boundaries. Every family has its own way of relating. As you join into a family, your expectations are unknown to them. So it’s vital to join with clear boundaries in place. In-laws have no prior knowledge of your needs, so they won’t respect unstated boundaries—no one can. When you pretend not to have any boundaries or wait for your partner to set them, you will suffer in your relationship with your in-laws. You can be kind and place boundaries with them respectfully. The items below suggest that you need healthier boundaries with your in-laws. Mark off all areas that apply to you. They make your special family events (such as a wedding) about them. They gossip about you with their other family members. They don’t like you and have told you as much. They openly share their negative views about you with your children. They question your parenting style. They make decisions for your family. They encourage your spouse or kids to keep secrets from you. They hear essential things happening with your partner before you hear about them. They give you gifts with strings attached. They give your kids things they know you wouldn’t want them to have. They don’t respect the way you parent your kids. I have the following boundaries with my in-laws: I need the following boundaries with my in-laws: Other Family Members (Siblings, Grandparents, Cousins, etc.) I have the following boundaries with ______________: I need the following boundaries with my adult children: Happy Holidays As a relationship therapist, my practice gets busy around the holidays. It’s the time of year when people become more anxious about finances and spend extended periods of time with family. The so-called most wonderful time of the year can be overwhelming when you don’t practice healthy boundaries. During the holiday season I struggle with: Instead of existing as I have, this holiday season, I can: Pause: Take a moment to stretch or breathe before moving on to the next activity.
