2 What Happens When We Don’t Have Healthy Boundaries? A life without healthy boundaries limits your ability to live your life on your own terms. What you want for yourself is clouded by what others say, think, and do. What you need is dimmed because of what others need. When you don’t own and manage your life, others will do it for you. People with unhealthy boundaries typically experience: Burnout: Emotional, mental, and/or physical exhaustion Resentment: Deep-rooted indignation about being mistreated Frustration: Feeling annoyed when asked to do something Anger: Hostility or annoyance, which might be expressed inwardly or outwardly Superhero syndrome: Unreasonable belief that they can do everything, often without support from others Anxiety: Setting unrealistic expectations, people-pleasing, and being unable to be assertive or say no Depression: Hopelessness that life can change or that relationships can improve Additionally, as a result of unhealthy boundaries, you might: Loan money to people when you don’t have it to give Offer advice when it isn’t requested Do things that you don’t like Be codependent Complain about how others mistreat you Not have any time for yourself Give people several chances to hurt you Tell people more than you’re comfortable sharing Feel resentful because you are overwhelmed Allow others to say things to you without speaking up for yourself Be frustrated by others whenever they request your support You may need boundaries with: Your parents Your kids Your partner Your time Associates In-laws Family Friends Neighbors Exes Strangers Work Social media Yourself Sometimes, healthy boundaries are about living your life according to your plans for your life. It’s okay to listen to someone else’s opinions, but stay mindful of who is offering their take on what’s best for you. When people tell you what you “should” do, remember staying on track with your goals is adhering to your boundaries. How you feel is a good indicator of whether you need to change your boundaries. For example, someone might say, “When I help my mother sort through her finances, I feel annoyed because I want her to know how to do it on her own. It would be helpful to teach her some of the strategies I’m using instead of doing it myself.” Sometimes, we help people because we believe they can’t do certain things on their own. In these instances, consider ways to empower them to be more self-sufficient or make use of other resources. This is particularly important when you can’t or don’t want to help. EXERCISE Consider the feelings listed below, and use them to complete the scenarios.

The “I Deserve Boundaries” Mindset Repeat After Me: “I deserve healthy boundaries in my relationships with others and with myself. Boundaries are not mean and can be placed gently. Even when people don’t like my boundaries, it doesn’t mean I’ve done anything wrong by setting them.” Get it out of your head that you’re a terrible person for setting boundaries, and remove the thought “boundaries are mean” from your mind and your mouth. Boundaries make you a healthier friend. Boundaries make you a healthier partner. Boundaries make you a healthier parent. Boundaries make you a healthier sister/brother. Boundaries make you a healthier daughter/son. Boundaries make you a healthier coworker. Boundaries make you a healthier niece/nephew. Boundaries make you a healthier family member. Boundaries make you a healthier neighbor. Boundaries make you a healthier human. EXERCISE Many people believe that saying no is the only way to set boundaries, but it’s just a small part of the process. Before we move on to other parts of boundaries, let’s practice a few ways to say no. For example, “Boundaries are a healthy way for me to heal.” Now, let’s consider times when you might say yes. For each of the items mentioned, circle “yes,” “maybe,” or “no”: Helping a friend move: Yes, Maybe, No Working on vacation: Yes, Maybe, No Answering your phone when it’s not a good time: Yes, Maybe, No Pet-sitting for a friend: Yes, Maybe, No Loaning a family member money: Yes, Maybe, No Allowing family to visit you for the holidays: Yes, Maybe, No ______________: Yes, Maybe, No ______________: Yes, Maybe, No ______________: Yes, Maybe, No ______________: Yes, Maybe, No For the ones you marked “maybe,” what stopped you from clearly declaring “yes” or “no”? What are the exceptions? When you responded with “no,” do you consistently say it in those areas? EXERCISE Part 1 Make a list of things you would like to start saying no to: Part 2 I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. I find it hard to say no to ______________ because ______________. Pause: At any point while going through this chapter, take a moment to close your eyes and envision a peaceful scene. For me, it’s standing in front of the ocean on a warm summer day. Common Reasons People Find It Hard to Say No People-pleasing: “I want to be liked,” or “I don’t want anyone to be upset with me.” Fear: “If I say no, they will stop talking to me.” Unreasonable expectations: “I know I’m busy, but adding one more thing won’t be too much trouble.” Common Negative-Thought Distortions That Make It Hard to Set Limits Catastrophizing: Expecting the worst-case scenario. “If I set a boundary with my partner, they will leave me.” Personalizing: Taking things to heart or making things about you when they aren’t. “It was my fault that they had too much to drink.” Overgeneralizing: Based on a single incident, developing a belief that things happen the same way all the time. “My friends can’t help me because they have their own problems and aren’t available.” Black-or-white thinking: Seeing things as one extreme or the other with no gray area. “People never care about what others want.” Jumping to conclusions: Expecting a negative outcome without trying. “They will never listen to me.” EXERCISE Looking at the cognitive distortions above, which one or two have you used most often? Instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario, what is a positive possible outcome? What affirmation (positive statement) can you use to increase your confidence in setting boundaries? Example: “I am worthy of healthy boundaries.” Unhealthy Alternatives to Setting Boundaries Move Away “I moved across town so that they would stop asking me to do things.” Gossip/Complain “My coworker needs to budget better. It never fails. Three days before payday, I end up buying them lunch.” Avoid “I don’t visit my grandmother because she always says something about my weight.” Cut Off “I stopped talking to my friend because she could never understand why she needs to be more respectful of my time.” JOURNAL PROMPT What have you done to avoid setting boundaries with people or with yourself? CHECKLIST What has stopped you from setting boundaries? Put a check mark next to each behavior that has held you back: People-pleasing Self-sabotage Second-guessing yourself Fear Anxiety Guilt How to Say No and Mean It Consistency is the key to getting people to respect your boundaries. When placing a limit with others, say no, not maybe. Don’t say, “Let me think about it” or “I will see what I can do.” Using pacifying statements only leads people to believe that there’s hope. You can be direct and still be a kind person. Communicating your boundaries kindly sounds like this: “I care about you deeply. I can’t help you with your issue.” “I’m not able to support you financially, but I’m willing to support you in another way.” “We need to reassess how we communicate, because it doesn’t seem to be working for either of us.” “Thank you for your request. I’m not available.” “I know you love me and want the best for me. I would like it if you supported me by listening instead of offering feedback.” “That sounds very challenging. I would love to help, but it seems like an issue that should be handled with a professional.” Nine Potential Reasons You Can’t Sufficiently Set a Boundary 1. You fear being mean. 2. You fear being rude. 3. You’re a people-pleaser. 4. You’re anxious about future interactions after a boundary has been set. 5. You feel powerless and not sure that boundaries will help. 6. You get your value from helping others. 7. You project onto others your feelings about being told no. 8. You have no clue where to start. 9. You believe that you can’t have boundaries in certain types of relationships. Gather Yourself What came up for you while going through this chapter?
