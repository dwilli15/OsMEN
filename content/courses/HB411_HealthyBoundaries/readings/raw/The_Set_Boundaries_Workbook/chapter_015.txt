12 The Family We Choose (Friends) Friends are the family we choose for ourselves. —Edna Buchanan Friendships are sacred relationships that we choose to have with others. Outside of family, they’re the hardest relationships for us to implement boundaries in. Sometimes, a friend might share a troubling experience they had with someone else, which gives you a clue about how they would respond to your boundaries. That can make you second-guess the safety of expressing your needs. Over time, we become keenly aware of how our friends are likely to respond to or feel about boundaries, and sometimes, we recognize the unhealthy parts of ourselves in them. To help you sort through your thoughts and feelings about placing boundaries with a friend, complete the following statement: My friend ______________ seems to have an issue when people ______________. This makes me feel ______________ about placing boundaries with them. The average friendship lasts about seven years. Three things happen that impact our ability to maintain friendships: 1. As we evolve, we change. Therefore, our friendships may no longer fit our current needs. It’s natural to transition from who we were, yet it can be hard to accept that friendships don’t always grow with us. 2. As we get older, we find it more challenging to dedicate time to friendships. As children, we’re able to be in the moment with others. As adults, we find that it becomes increasingly hard to balance our friendships with our family life, work life, and other demands. 3. Childhood friendships are primarily based on proximity and shared interests. Children play with one another without knowing much about someone’s personality. Adult relationships are formed around connection, personality, values, shared interests, and other factors. Therefore, finding “our people” becomes slightly more complicated. The critical part of maintaining friendships is continuing to nurture healthy ones. If you’ve lost touch with someone, reach out to them. If you want to create new friendships, consider the people you already have in your life, such as coworkers and acquaintances, and work toward deepening those connections. LIST YOUR FRIENDSHIPS THAT HAVE LASTED LONGER THAN SEVEN YEARS. LIST FRIENDSHIPS THAT YOU’VE BUILT WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. On the checklists below, mark each response that resonates with you. SIGNS OF A HEALTHY FRIENDSHIP Your friend wants to see you grow. The friendship is mutually supportive. The friendship is mutually beneficial. Your friendship evolves as you evolve. You understand how to support each other. Setting boundaries doesn’t threaten the friendship. Your friend is happy for you to be yourself. Your friend acknowledges your quirks and works around them. You can talk to your friend about your feelings. SIGNS OF AN UNHEALTHY FRIENDSHIP The relationship is competitive. You exhibit your worst behavior when you’re with your friend. You feel emotionally drained after connecting with your friend. Your friend tries to embarrass you in front of others. You don’t have anything in common. Your friend shares details of your personal life with others. The friendship is not reciprocal (i.e., you give more than you receive). You’re unable to work through disagreements. Your friend doesn’t respect your boundaries. The relationship is enmeshed or codependent. Using the checklists above, which of your friendships meet the criteria for healthy friendships, and which meet the criteria for unhealthy friendships? List them below: Common Issues in Friendships Complaining Many of us need someone to talk to, but we can’t always be that person for those who deplete our energy and impact our mental health. Remember that your needs matter, too, and you deserve to have mutually supportive conversations. It’s okay to redirect the conversation, minimize talk time, and not respond when it isn’t a good time for you. While talking about problems is cathartic, listening to someone talk about their problems regularly can be draining. Complaining falls into one of three categories: venting, problem-solving, or ruminating. Venting is a way to talk about issues without seeking guidance, but rather to simply let out our frustrations. Problem-solving is seeking guidance or advice on how to correct an issue. Ruminating is talking about the same issues over and over without trying to problem-solve or work through our frustrations in any real way. When your friend is a chronic complainer, what can you say to shift the conversation? 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Being the Therapist in the Relationship You may be great at giving sound advice, but if you’re tired, you can stop. List seven things you can do instead of offering advice and feedback. Hint: Just listening can be one of the best ways to support someone. Helping someone without offering solutions sounds like this: “I hear you. How can I support you?” “Thank you for trusting me with that.” “Please tell me what you need from me.” “I’m listening.” “Cry, and feel what you need to.” “Thank you for sharing with me.” “I love you, and I’m here for you.” “I don’t have an answer, but I’m here to listen.” Differences of Opinion The beautiful thing about communication is that you can decide how you respond. In any relationship, you won’t always agree with the other person. Instead of talking about hot-button topics, focus the conversation on areas that allow you to enjoy your time together. Complete the following statement. With ______________, I enjoy talking about ______________. With them, I don’t enjoy talking about ______________. Remember, you don’t have to talk about everything with everyone, and you don’t have to listen to a friend’s opinion on every topic. Examples: “I’m not looking for feedback, I just want to vent.” “I’m already sure of what I want to do in this situation.” “I’m not ready to share more at this time.” Important Reminder: Not everyone gives sound advice. Some advice is biased. Some advice is rooted in fear. Some advice comes from people who don’t have the tools to help you. When seeking advice, consider who you’re talking to and if their perspective is for you. Seek wise counsel. Pause: Take a moment to think about what type of friend you are to others. Addressing Issues as They Arise In any relationship, the best time to address issues is in the moment. Sometimes you may not notice that you have an issue with something, but it’s best to address it as soon as you realize it. If you ruminate and wait until the perfect time, you’ll likely express your boundary in an aggressive or passive-aggressive manner. Let’s practice addressing boundary violations right away. You planned a lunch with your friends outdoors. The restaurant has a ten-minute window for holding reservations, and one of your friends has a history of being late. What will you say or do? Your friend constantly solicits your advice on her marriage. You feel uncomfortable telling her what’s best. As you’re talking to her, she says, “I’m considering separating from my partner.” What will you say or do? You find out your friend is sharing your business with other mutual friends. What will you say or do? Reasons People Stay in Unhealthy Friendships Longevity Sometimes you’ve been friends with someone for so long that you learn to tolerate and accommodate unhealthy behaviors. Carrying on friendships or any relationship beyond its expiration date typically leaves you feeling depleted and resentful. It’s understandable that you’d want to maintain friendships with the people who’ve known you since middle school, but consider if those connections are unhealthy. Going Through a Rough Patch Lots of people go through things in their personal lives that impact their friendships. When this is the case, hopefully it’s temporary. When it’s prolonged, however, it might not be just a rough patch. It could be an indication that the friendship isn’t healthy for you. Staying for Hope Hoping someone will change is not a good reason for staying in an unhealthy relationship. Waiting for Something Big to Happen Although the relationship is unhealthy, you might be waiting for something big to happen in order to gather the courage to end it. Fear of Dealing with the Discomfort The fear of the fallout if you leave the friendship may seem like an insurmountable barrier to change. It’s undoubtedly sad when relationships end, but it may be the best thing for you. Leaving a relationship takes consideration and clarity. In the past, I’ve stayed in unhealthy friendships because: Presently, I’m choosing to remain in unhealthy friendships because: Important Reminder: Breaking up with a friend may hurt even when it is the best thing for you. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of the friendship. You can move forward without forgetting about the relationship. Friendships are deep connections, and it makes sense to be deeply impacted when a friendship ends. A few reminders about friendships: As you shift, so will your friendships. It’s okay to outgrow people. At different points in life, you will need different things from different people. Frenemies are not friends. You can, but you are not obligated to, tell your friends everything. You can’t keep a friendship together on your own. WHAT DO YOU NEED? What boundaries would you like to have in your friendships?
