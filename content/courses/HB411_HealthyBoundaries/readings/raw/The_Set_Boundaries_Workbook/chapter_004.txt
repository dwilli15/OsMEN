1 What Does It Mean to Have Healthy Boundaries? When I told people I was writing a book about boundaries, one said, “You’re writing a book about cutting people off?” Another person said, “I have great boundaries: I know how to say no.” Having healthy boundaries could mean saying no and cutting people off. But that’s only scratching the surface. EXERCISE To better understand what you think about boundaries, use the diagram below to explore what they mean to you. It’s important to know what language and behaviors you use to describe them. A Working Definition of “Boundaries” Boundaries are ways to communicate our needs to others via words and actions. They are also perimeters that we establish with ourselves and others. Therefore, boundaries aren’t just about telling other people what to do but are also about holding yourself accountable for creating your life. Boundaries are expectations and needs that help you feel safe and comfortable in your relationships. Expectations in relationships help you stay mentally and emotionally well. An essential part of feeling comfortable in interactions with others is also learning when to say no or yes. In society, we live with lots of boundaries and rules of engagement. For example, traffic lights are boundaries that control the flow of traffic and keep drivers safe. We all have plenty of practice adhering to boundaries; even the people with whom you have the most difficult time setting boundaries have experience obeying rules. CHECKLIST It’s important to know the signs that you are suffering from unhealthy boundaries, and it’s important to react before you lose your peace or find yourself in crisis. Check the signs that apply to you at this time: Neglecting self-care Feeling overwhelmed Desire to run away from your responsibilities Resentment Avoiding interactions with others Burnout Always the helper, never the one being helped Inability to say no Unable to ask for help Difficulty allowing others to help you Doing things with no support Rescuing others Loaning money or possessions Why Is It Important to Have Healthy Boundaries? Anxiety, depression, and burnout, among other issues, can result from your inability to set healthy expectations with yourself and others. Your body and mind know when you’ve had too much. Unfortunately, it’s common for people to fight against the signs that limitations are needed. We can’t do it all, and we shouldn’t try. We can’t be everything to everyone, and we shouldn’t try. We can’t please everyone, and we shouldn’t try. How Do I Know If I Have Unhealthy Boundaries? Pay attention to your feelings. Do you regularly ignore the desire in your head to say no? It’s time to start listening to that desire.

Type 1: Porous Boundaries Porous boundaries are weak or poorly expressed, and they are unintentionally harmful to you. They lead to feeling depleted, overextending yourself, depression, anxiety, and unhealthy relationship dynamics. Porous boundaries are often the cause of enmeshment (lacking emotional separation between you and another person), codependency (unhealthy closeness), and people-pleasing. Examples of porous boundaries (enmeshment): Spending no time apart Entangling other people’s emotions and thoughts with your own (no separation) Sharing everything because it’s expected Seeing differences as a threat Agreeing with everything Believing it’s your job to fix other people Maintaining all the same thoughts and values Never making decisions without including others Being unable to say no Supporting unhealthy habits that keep people dependent People are not able to exist without help from others. Needing people is not codependence. Enmeshing with them and losing who you are is codependence. Making it your job to rescue them from problems of their own doing (without being asked) is codependence. Losing touch with your needs and taking on someone else’s is codependence. Mutual closeness is healthy, but entangling who you are and how you feel based on someone else is not healthy. Type 2: Rigid Boundaries (Strict Rules) Rigid boundaries involve building walls to keep others out as a way to keep yourself safe. But staying safe by locking yourself in is also unhealthy and leads to a whole other set of problems. Rigid boundaries are a self-protective mechanism meant to build distance. This typically comes from a fear of vulnerability or a history of being taken advantage of. People with rigid boundaries don’t allow exceptions to their stringent rules even when it would be healthy for them. Rigid boundaries lead to counter-dependency, where we start to believe that we don’t need anyone. Think “the strong one” who believes that they can handle everything without help. CHECKLIST Use the lists below to check off signs that your boundaries are either porous or rigid. Porous Oversharing Codependency Enmeshment Inability to say no People-pleasing Dependency on feedback from others Paralyzing fear of being rejected Accepting mistreatment Rigid Never sharing Building walls Avoiding vulnerability Cutting people out Having high expectations of others Enforcing strict rules When your boundaries feel unhealthy, do they tend to be porous or rigid? Healthy Boundaries When your boundaries are healthy, you are clear about your needs, you say no when needed, you respect other people’s boundaries, and you share yourself in ways that feel comfortable to you. Healthy boundaries in one relationship don’t mean healthy boundaries across relationships. You can be excellent at setting boundaries at work and with your friends but struggle with setting boundaries with your parents. For example, your fears and how people have made you feel comfortable or uncomfortable in a relationship may determine the level of difficulty you have in setting boundaries in certain areas. Pause: At any point while going through these exercises, take a moment to stop and be mindful of your breath. Focus your attention on breathing in deeply through your nose and out through your mouth. EXERCISE Please circle the type of boundaries most present for you in each of these relationships.
