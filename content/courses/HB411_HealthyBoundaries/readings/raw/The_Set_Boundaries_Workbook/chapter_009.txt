6 How to Speak Your Boundaries (So People Can Hear You) Three Steps to Setting a Boundary Step 1 Be clear, and focus on the solution, not the problem. Often when we think we’re setting boundaries, we are mostly talking about the problem. The boundary is the solution. What would you like? What do you want to see next time? What would make you feel safe? Going over a problem without discussing the solution will lead people to repeat the behavior causing the issue. Sometimes, the person who is causing a problem may be unaware of alternative solutions, or simply doesn’t know what your limit is. You should be able to condense what you need into one or two sentences, maximum. For example, “I’m not able to take care of your plants while you’re on vacation.” Not this: “I don’t know why you asked me to care for your plants while you’re on vacation. You know I have a black thumb. The last time you asked me to watch your plants, one died, and you complained about my ability to care for them. Why don’t you ask someone who knows more about plants?” Also not this: “You should ask your sister to water your plants instead.” Remember, the boundary is the solution. It’s up to the other person to make new arrangements. It’s imperative to be clear and concise, particularly if you are new to setting boundaries. People can find your weaknesses if you aren’t secure in what you’re saying. As a result, they can easily talk you out of your boundary. As you become more confident in setting boundaries, you can add more to your explanation, but remain clear and concise. You don’t have to explain your need for safety. It’s okay if what you need looks different from what others need. Step 2 State what you need and want, or say no. Speak your truth in the following ways: I want... I need... I expect... Next time... Step 3 Manage your discomfort. It’s normal to feel guilt, fear, sadness, remorse, awkwardness, indifference, or relief when setting boundaries. Guilt is often the most challenging part of the process, but it’s to be expected, especially if you’re new to it. Guilt shows that you are emotionally aware and are concerned about potentially hurting others. But don’t let your guilt stop you from doing what you need for your well-being. Also, after setting a boundary, it’s normal to feel relieved. The hard part is over. You did it! And even when people aren’t happy with your boundaries, it feels good to get the fundamental hard part out of the way. EXERCISE Name someone in your family who has said things that led you to feel guilty for honoring yourself. What was the boundary? Name a friend who has said things that led you to feel guilty for honoring yourself. What was the boundary? Name a partner (past or present) who has said things that led you to feel guilty for honoring yourself. What was the boundary? A few ways to manage discomfort: Feel it (just sit with it, without pushing it away or doing anything) Journal Move your body Call a friend Cry Watch something funny Hug someone Take a nap Tap into a creative outlet What to Say and How to Say It The hardest part is finding the right words. But there aren’t any absolutely “right” words. When helping my clients figure out how to speak their needs to others, I often find myself saying, “You already have the words.” But it makes sense that we want to practice what to say over and over because we don’t want to offend or hurt someone. Just know that while there aren’t perfect “right” words, there are wrong words that you want to avoid. These include demeaning others or attacking someone’s character. As long as you don’t do that, your words will be right. EXERCISE Let’s practice what to say. In this exercise, focus on what you’re trying to convey and not on wanting to please the other person. 1. A friend asks you to dog-sit for two weeks while they visit family. You don’t want to take on the task, because in the past the dog whined and kept you up at night. What do you say to your friend? 2. You have plans for your birthday, and your partner keeps insisting that you should do something other than what you have planned. You want to stick to your plans. What do you say to your partner? 3. Your mother stays in touch with your ex after the terrible breakup between the two of you. She says that despite what you experienced with your ex, their relationship remains intact. Your mother brings up their interactions often, and it makes you uncomfortable. What do you say to your mother? 4. When you and your best friend became roommates, you assumed they would pitch in to clean the house. Your feelings about how your friend maintains the house are starting to impact your desire to engage with them. What do you say to your friend? Let’s practice saying: “I would like you to listen instead of offering solutions.” “I feel more than one way, and I don’t have to pick one way to feel.” “I feel unsafe in this interaction.” “Please respect my decision.” “I don’t feel comfortable sharing with you because you tend to tell me what’s best for me instead of listening.” “I need a few moments to myself.” “I need to vent. Do you have a moment to listen?” “I’m not looking for advice. I just want to vent.” “This isn’t the best time for me to talk. I will call you back when I can give you my full attention.” “I know you meant well, but what you said wasn’t helpful.” “How would you like me to support you?” “I need your help with ______________.” Five Ways to Communicate a Boundary Passive: denying or ignoring your needs to allow others to be comfortable Aggressive: having rigid and inflexible standards of how to engage with others; applying strict rules to all people; sharing boundaries in an abrasive manner or doing so to offend Passive-aggressive: having boundaries but not making them clear to others; assuming that people know your boundaries and then getting frustrated when your boundaries are violated Manipulative: issuing ultimatums to be punitive; threatening to do things you won’t follow through on Assertive: having clear and concise expectations EXERCISE In the scenarios below, identify if the boundary is expressed in a way that feels passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, manipulative, or assertive. 1. Your boss emails you while you’re on vacation. Your response: When you return to work, you give your boss the cold shoulder for the day because they should’ve known better than to bother you while on vacation. What type of response did you have? ______________ 2. Your father calls you by your family nickname in front of friends and in public places. You would prefer him to call you by your given name. Your response: You don’t mention it to your dad because it’s what he has always done. What type of response did you have? ______________ 3. You’re invited to a Zoom birthday celebration at the same time as another online event you prepaid for. Your response: “Thank you for the invitation, but I won’t be able to attend.” What type of response did you have? ______________ 4. Your brother asks you to store a few things in your garage while he moves. He promises to have everything out within a month. It’s been one year, and his things are still in your garage. Your response: Every month, you call him to tell him to get his things or you will throw them out. What type of response did you have? ______________ 5. Your food delivery order was not prepared correctly. Your response: You call the restaurant, yelling and cussing at the manager because you’re pissed off. What type of response did you have? ______________ Key: 1. Passive-aggressive; 2. Passive; 3. Assertive; 4. Manipulative; 5. Aggressive Pause: Take a moment to listen to the sounds in your environment. What are they? How do they make you feel? Because setting a boundary is challenging, let’s practice a little bit more. EXERCISE Look at the list of five ways to communicate a boundary, and write an example for each of the ways using the following scenario: An acquaintance, a friend of a friend, asks you to plan their milestone birthday party. Passive: Aggressive: Passive-aggressive: Manipulative: Assertive: Your coworker asks you to pay when you grab lunch, saying they’ll pay you back. They haven’t paid you back from the last time you grabbed lunch. Passive: Aggressive: Passive-aggressive: Manipulative: Assertive: Your friend’s partner makes inappropriate comments about your weight in front of your friend, who doesn’t defend you. Passive: Aggressive: Passive-aggressive: Manipulative: Assertive: Provide an example of when someone has communicated a boundary with you in the following ways. Passive: Aggressive: Passive-aggressive: Manipulative: Assertive: Note: Pay close attention to how you implement your boundaries. It’s expected that when you first start expressing limits, you may go at full throttle and be slightly aggressive. Learn as you go. Assertiveness sounds like this: “My food wasn’t prepared properly. I want a refund.” “I’m not satisfied with my haircut. I would like you to fix it.” “The next time you’re going to be late, please let me know ahead of time.” “I don’t think it’s funny to talk about my weight.” “I don’t want to talk about having kids.” “I’m not seeking feedback.” “I’m speaking.” “I don’t want to talk about my dating life.” “I feel supported when you honor my wishes.” How to Handle People Who Don’t Listen to Your Boundaries No matter how assertive you are, there may be some people who challenge your boundaries. When this happens, it’s important to remember that you are doing something healthy for yourself. JOURNAL PROMPT What are your thoughts and feelings about setting boundaries with difficult people? List a few affirmations that might help you follow through with your boundaries. Examples: “Despite my feeling of guilt, I am acting in my best interest.” “I can push through even when there is pushback.” Reimagine Your Beliefs About Boundaries As you practice what could go wrong, it’s important to consider that things could and often do go better than expected. In this next exercise, I want you to consider something positive happening. BOUNDARY: “I want to stay at a hotel when I visit my family.” CHALLENGING THOUGHT: They will be hurt and disappointed because they are used to me staying with them. POSITIVE POSSIBILITY: My family will understand my desire for space, and we’ll be able to have a nice visit that feels less tense for me. Repeat After Me: “I am not responsible for how people respond to my boundaries. I am responsible for setting and honoring my boundaries. If my relationships end because I set boundaries, it’s a sign that the foundation was cracked. In healthy relationships, I can set boundaries without fear of retaliation, cutoffs, or manipulation.” Six Steps to Setting Boundaries with Challenging People 1. Assertively restate the boundary as needed. 2. Correct the violation in real time. Don’t let the opportunity pass and then mention it later. Say it in the moment. 3. Be consistent with implementing your boundaries. 4. Accept that they, although difficult, are entitled to their response even if it’s different from the one you’d like. 5. Choose not to take it personally. They want to do what they want to do. You’re asking them to do something uncomfortable that’s likely difficult for them. 6. Manage your discomfort. EXERCISE Decide how you want to respond to the people who are especially challenging to set boundaries with by brainstorming responses. When ______________ violates my boundary regarding ______________, I will ______________. Gather Yourself Remember, practice is an essential part of getting better at setting and maintaining boundaries. The more you move through the workbook and familiarize yourself with different strategies, the more confident you’ll feel about saying complicated things.
