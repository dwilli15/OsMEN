8 How Your Childhood Impacts Your Adult Boundaries Childhood and adult trauma impact the way we perceive and engage in the world around us. Types of trauma can range from sexual abuse to witnessing a car accident. Indications of trauma are evident in how people respond. For example, the adult child of an alcoholic may fear driving because they frequently rode in the car with a drunk parent behind the wheel. SELF-ASSESSMENT What type of trauma have you experienced? Please check each box that applies. Emotional abuse Neglect (physical or emotional) Bullying Sexual abuse, sexual assault, or rape Having an absent parent Physical abuse or physical violence Death of a loved one Pregnancy loss Verbal abuse Car accident Infertility Raised by caregivers who abused substances Death of a friend Near-death experience Difficult breakup Chronic health issues Witnessed a violent or an abusive event Childhood Trauma Adults live with the scars of childhood trauma, and in many cases, it affects how we engage in relationships. It may also affect our attachments with the people and things in our lives. Adults carry the following from childhood: Engaging in unhealthy relationships Self-sabotage Low self-esteem Addiction Codependency Unhealthy boundaries Perfectionism Emotional unavailability Guilt when caring for self Guilt for healing Saying no and setting expectations is especially demanding for us when it wasn’t taught or honored in childhood. LET’S EXPLORE YOUR STORY Do you remember your early boundaries? Who was the first person to honor one of your boundaries? What was the boundary? Who was the first person to dishonor your boundary? What was the boundary? Pause: Before moving on to the next exercise, take a break from the work if you need to, and return to it when you feel centered. If you feel comfortable moving forward, take a few moments to breathe before continuing. EXERCISE When I was a child, this would have been a helpful boundary: I felt heard and seen by the following people: I wanted to be seen by these people: I recall my caregivers having the following rules for me: I remember having the following boundaries for myself: If I said no in my house, the following happened: I wish my caregivers would’ve taught me this: I think adults should honor the following boundaries with children: Affirmation I will no longer use the excuse “my parents never taught me” as a reason to not do better. I can teach myself by reading, by being open to learning, by being curious, and by connecting to healthy people. I can find support through mentors, role models, elders, or mental health professionals. I can learn things that I was never taught, including how to be in healthy relationships, how to feel, how to care for myself, how to be assertive, and how to deal with problems in a healthy way. Understanding What You Need from Others When you share your experience from a traumatic event, compassionate support can facilitate your healing. Let’s practice ways of asking for what you need. Brainstorm a few ways to ask for support, and try to be specific about what works for you. For example, “When I cry, please rub my back, and tell me everything will be okay.” Guilt A normal but not always helpful response to trauma is guilt—the kind of guilt that may cause you to feel bad about yourself and sometimes do unhealthy things. Real guilt: You did something wrong. False guilt: You believe you did something wrong, but you didn’t. To wash your hands of guilt that isn’t yours to carry, complete the following statements: When ______________ happened, it was not my fault. When ______________ happened, it was not my fault. When ______________ happened, it was not my fault. When ______________ happened, it was not my fault. Remember This: You can feel guilty when you aren’t doing anything wrong. Guilt may be a part of your conditioning. You can unlearn the belief that everything is your fault or that you have done something harmful to others. The way to feel less guilty is to practice placing boundaries within yourself and with others. Do the work until it feels normal and habitual for you. The guilt will subside as you retrain your brain not to blame yourself for what others feel or experience. You Can Say No A two-year-old’s favorite word is “no,” and they say it with conviction because they feel entitled not to like, want, or be something that doesn’t feel right. You can tap into your inner two-year-old and boldly reclaim your ability to say no with the belief that you are entitled to it. When was the last time someone told you no? What have you recently said no to? How did it make you feel at the time? How do you feel about it now? Why did you say no? Ways to say no now: EXERCISE: TRAUMA AND BOUNDARIES When I was younger, I responded to my trauma in the following ways: As an adult, I respond to my trauma in the following ways: Gather Yourself Using the blank bullet points below, create your own affirming statements. I can teach myself what I wish my parents would’ve taught me. I forgive myself for blaming myself when things weren’t my fault. I recognize that some people won’t apologize or recognize what they did as “wrong.” I can be for myself what I need from others. I can’t forget what happened, but I can learn to cope with what happened. I am not alone. I can create a healthy life. I don’t have to repeat the cycle. __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________
