RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 29 Assumptions “Not to do evil, to do good, to purify one’s mind—this is the teaching of the Buddhas. It is difficult to obtain human birth; it is difficult to live with the certainty of death; it is difficult to hear the precious Dharma; the appearance of an Awakened One is rarer still. It is hard to find a person of great wisdom. Such a person is not born everywhere. Wherever a wise one is born, the family thrives in happiness.” The Dhammapada, Chapter 14 (The Buddha), verse 182-183. “Surely there is no one on earth so righteous as to do good without ever sinning.” Ecclesiastes 7:20 This Is about All of Us • This is about all of us. We all have various relationships with congregants, staff, students, volunteers. • This is about all of us. We all have experienced (or have the potential to experience) sexual or romantic attraction to students, congregants, and those with whom we work. • This is about all of us. We all have experienced (or have the potential to experience) sexual come-ons from students, congregants, and those with whom we work. • This is about all of us. We all have been tempted or have crossed boundaries with students, congregants, and those with whom we work. • Some of us have been abused by a spiritual leader or other authority figure. • The work of ministry and teaching is intimate. We are intimately involved in the lives of those whom we serve or supervise. We have unique influence and access. • Every day we are challenged to maintain the integrity of our ministerial/teaching relationships. Ministry/Teaching as a Profession Some spiritual leaders resist considering themselves “a professional.” They have negative associations with the category of “professional.” They see “professionals” as formal, aloof, uninvolved, uncaring—all of which contradict their sense of themselves as spiritual leaders. But in fact, the term “professional” traditionally means something very different. In all of the helping professions (medicine, teaching, ministry, law), it assumes: • A sense of calling • Specialized knowledge acquired through training • Standards for performance SECTION 1 30 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE • Accountability to those who are served • Power and authority to be used in the interest of those served: “unique access and influence” (a fiduciary role) This understanding of the values of the professional can help us place our role as spiritual leader in the context of the community’s well-being and our accountability to the community. Power in Ministry/Teaching: A Neutral Fact of Life • Power can be used to control others, to preserve privilege, and to sustain the hierarchy to which it is accountable. • Power can be used to provide leadership and to protect the vulnerable; it originates in the call of the community and is accountable to the community. • Power can be used as a co-creative force to produce. The Bottom Line • It’s never okay to violate the boundaries of a ministerial/teaching relationship. • It’s always our responsibility as leaders to maintain healthy boundaries because even under usual circumstances, we are in a position to do so. • It’s never simple because circumstances are always complicated. Our goal in better understanding ethics, boundaries, and power is to be clear about the bottom lines that help us maintain the integrity of our ministerial/teaching relationships. 1 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 31 Who Are Perpetrators in Spiritual Communities? Perpetrators within spiritual communities exhibit a wide range of behavioral and personality traits. They cannot be characterized by a single list of traits; they cannot be identified through psychological testing. Rather, these perpetrators fall along a continuum. At one extreme is the type we call “the wanderer”; at the other extreme is “the predator.”1 It is important to note that the effect on the victim is not determined by the type of perpetrator. Perpetration by a wanderer can be just as damaging as abuse by a predator. We need to understand who perpetrators are in order to address their misconduct directly and to hopefully prevent them from causing harm to anyone else. Wanderers Predators What Behaviors Differentiate Them? Wanderer Wanders across boundaries and lacks awareness or judgment Predator Is predatory, unremorseful, and lacks conscience2 What Is the Prognosis for Change? Wanderer Fair to good, if highly motivated to change and if able to fully take responsibility for their misconduct when confronted Predator Poor to fair, even if highly motivated to change; unlikely to take responsibility for their misconduct when confronted Traits Common to Most Perpetrating Spiritual Leaders • Controlling, dominating • Limited self-awareness • Limited or no awareness of boundary issues • No sense of damage caused by own behavior • Poor judgment • Willingness to risk everything 1 Anyone who is sexual with a child is by definition predatory. 2 People who exhibit such behaviors have likely experienced high levels of trauma in their life. We often colloquially call these people “sociopaths” or “psychopaths” whether or not they fit the definition for Anti-Social Personality Disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). SECTION 1 32 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE • Narcissistic3 • Limited impulse control • Limited understanding of consequences of actions • Often charismatic, sensitive, talented, inspirational, and effective in ministry • Motivated by desire for power/control/sex • Sense of entitlement: “the rules don’t apply to me”; assumes perks that come with the position Behaviors Common to Most Perpetrating Spiritual Leaders4 • Often seek out vulnerable people • May attract vulnerable people • Secretive • Manipulative • Will minimize, deny, rationalize, and blame when confronted • Often isolated from colleagues Having a basic understanding of who perpetrators are is important to any organizational leadership trying to discern their response to a complaint. In evaluating information from the investigation, a committee may be presented with a “he said/ she said” situation. The allegations from the complainant are often denied by the accused spiritual leader. A committee with little understanding about the characteristics of a professional who violates boundaries and causes harm is most likely to consider this situation from their own perspective. Most of us tend to view the world with some sense of conscience. This means that when we do something that is hurtful or harmful to another person, we feel bad and want to rectify the situation. We also know that we couldn’t lie about what we did. When we listen to a colleague, whom we have known and perhaps trusted in the past, emphatically deny all the allegations of the complaint, we are likely to believe that person because we can’t imagine that they would lie. The problem is that if this person is highly traumatized themselves, lying may not be a problem for them, and their agenda at this point is to control and manipulate the process in order to minimize negative consequences to themselves. A governing body charged with adjudication has to understand that things are not always as they seem and be able to carefully judge the information before them. In addition, governing bodies/committees are often tempted to send an accused spiritual leader to a therapist and to ask the therapist to determine whether or not this person is an abuser. A therapeutic evaluation cannot answer this question. The question before the judicatory committee is: Did this spiritual leader do the things alleged by the complainant? Did they engage in the alleged behavior that would violate the policy? This is a question of violating the ethics policy. The committee is not looking for a clinical diagnosis; it is making a judgment on whether or not the policy was violated based on the evidence. (See “Guidelines for Assessing Evidence” below) 3 Or people who exhibit narcissistic behavior, not necessarily those having Narcissistic Personality Disorder as defined by the DSM-5. 4 See Section 3: “Response to the Accused Spiritual Leader” below. 1 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 33 Once the complaint is adjudicated, i.e. the committee has determined that the misconduct did occur and did violate the policy, then a clinical assessment may help determine disciplinary actions. Under this circumstance, if the spiritual leader acknowledges their misconduct, takes responsibility, and is willing to address their boundary issues, clinical treatment may be useful. (This is a possibility with “wanderers.”) If the spiritual leader is unable to acknowledge their misconduct or take responsibility, and is unwilling to address their boundary issues, clinical treatment will not be useful. (This is a probability with “predators.”) (See “What Is the Prognosis for Change?” above) Clinical treatment is not meant to convince someone they have a problem with their professional boundaries. It is meant to be a resource to someone who knows they have a problem. Boundary Training e I v n cti e f f e e Eff c ti v e Wanderers Predators Continuum of the Violator’s Intentions n Vi ol atio a ti o Viol n Consequences are the same  This infographic shows the wanderer-predator continuum in relation to boundaries training and consequences. Boundaries training may be effective for those closer to the wanderer side of the continuum; it may not be for predators. It’s important to remember, however, that the consequences are, and should be, the same for anyone who violates a boundary, no matter where they fall on this continuum. SECTION 1 RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 35 Who Are the Victims? ANYONE can be taken advantage of by a spiritual leader regardless of age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexuality, or circumstance. VULNERABILITY makes people susceptible to victimization. It also makes them susceptible to coercion and manipulation by someone they trust. Children or teens are particularly vulnerable due to: • Age, size, lack of awareness or knowledge, lack of experience • Sexual abuse or domestic violence in the home • Dependence on adults due to:  The need for adult approval  An instinctive trust of adults  A reliance on adults’ interpretations of feelings, thoughts, and experiences  A special relationship with the adult involved Adults are particularly vulnerable due to: • Lesser power, gender, fewer resources, emotional needs, being in crisis, history of abuse, expectations of and feelings about minister or teacher:  May trust in spiritual leader as a respected authority figure  May assume spiritual leaders are safe people to confide in because of their position (or because of celibacy vows, like for Roman Catholic priests or Buddhist monastics of certain lineages)  May be attracted to the leader’s sensitivity, caring style, charisma, or power  May attempt to sexualize the relationship Survivors of sexual abuse and boundary violations by spiritual leaders report these attempts by abusers to manipulate them: • “After I told him about the sexual abuse by my father, he said we needed to re-enact it in order for me to get over it...” • “He was the first person to take me seriously as an intellectual person, who would teach me the Torah...” • “I wanted a spiritual mentor. She was good at that. So I decided I had to take the whole package.” • “I didn’t want to do what he asked me to do, but he said it would help my marriage problems. I trusted him.” • “No harm, no foul. But he said it was our special secret.” SECTION 1 36 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE Tragically, the moral agency and otherwise good judgment of the congregant, client, or student is compromised by the manipulation of the trusted leader who serves as the person’s moral guide. I the individual has initial moral qualms, they are quickly dispensed with by the spiritual leader. When it comes to sexual abuse in particular, the congregant, client, or student may initially be a willing participant in the spiritual leader’s behavior. The fallacy is that they are a consenting participant because consent is not an option in a relationship where there is an imbalance of power. For most people, this finally becomes apparent; this is when the congregant, client, or student begins to blame themselves, doubt God or their closest held beliefs, and feel confused and powerless. They may think about disclosure. The responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the ministerial or teaching relationship fundamentally lies with the spiritual leader. + + + = Any Person Vulnerability Perpetrator Secrecy Victimization The question that confronts us is how do we interrupt this equation? We have two options. First, we can remove the perpetrator to try to ensure that this person is not in a position to take advantage. + + + = HoweAvnery, Psoemrseotnimes wVe umlnisesr athbailti toypportuPneitryp.e Tthraetno rit is impoSrteacnrte cthyat we reVmicotvime tihzae tsioecnrecy that the perpetrator seeks to establish in order to deny them the advantage. We do this by discussing the problem of boundaries for spiritual leaders openly and widely with community members and by providing access to an organization or community’s policy. Information and awareness deny the secrecy required for manipulation and coercion. + + + = Any Person Vulnerability Perpetrator Secrecy Victimization 1 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 37 Spiritual Leader Sexual Abuse & Misconduct When we hear a rumor about spiritual leaders violating sexual boundaries, how is it usually labeled? • “an affair” • “an indiscretion” • “guru devotion” • “a lapse of judgment” • “a mid-life crisis” • “sexual addiction” • “adultery” • “he’s a player” • “true love” • “therapy for the congregant/student” • “a problem with his zipper” • “non-western values” • “betrayal of celibacy” Although each of these labels communicates that the spiritual leader in question has allegedly violated sexual boundaries (i.e. we all know what it means), none of these labels really adequately describes what the spiritual leader has done. If we are to realistically intervene and confront misconduct, we have to be clear about what it is. The way we frame and define spiritual leader misconduct will determine how we respond to it. Often an organizational policy will frame the spiritual sexual misconduct as “adultery” and make this the ethical basis for addressing it. There are several problems with this: first, it does not adequately describe the ethical violation; second, it then addresses only married or partnered spiritual leaders; and third, it does not allow for attention to the victim of the misconduct. “Adultery” is a matter of personal misconduct, but not professional misconduct. As such, it is very significant for the minister and their partner; it is a violation of their relationship. Adultery is the result of the professional misconduct, and the professional conduct of our leaders should be the primary concern for the spiritual community. The harm done to the spiritual leader’s partner and family is collateral; the issue here is spiritual leader misconduct and harm to congregants or students. (See Section 2: “Ethical Analysis: What’s Wrong with Spiritual Leader Sexual Misconduct and Abuse?”) SECTION 1 38 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE The language below both describes the who, what, when, and where and takes a moral position. For example, Spiritual leader misconduct is when any person in a ministerial or teaching role of leadership or pastoral counseling (clergy, religious, or lay) engages in harmful behaviors that violate the ministerial or teaching relationship. Violations can include sexual contact, sexual harassment or sexualized behavior with a congregant, client, employee, student, or staff member (adult, teenager, or child), financial irresponsibility or irregularities, violations of confidentiality, use of technology for illegal or harmful purposes, intentional deception or dishonesty including misrepresenting personal qualifications, acts of physical, emotional, spiritual violence or bullying, and gross negligence of ministerial responsibilities. Such misconduct is a violation of the ministerial/teaching relationship in which a person in a position of leadership takes advantage of a vulnerable person. Spiritual relationships look like these: • A congregant seeking guidance from a minister • A teacher leading a retreat for her sangha • An altar server serving a priest • A spiritual community/organization employee in relation to her supervisor • A parent volunteer in relation to the youth leader • A student in dokusan/private meeting with their teacher • A student intern supervised by a senior minister • A synagogue secretary in relation to the rabbi • A volunteer coordinator for religious education in relation to their minister • A child in relation to an elder in her community Remember our goal within our spiritual communities is: To maintain the integrity of ministerial/teaching relationships and to protect vulnerable persons such as congregants, clients, employees, students, staff, and others. 1 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 39 Harassment Harassment in spiritual communities can take many forms. Here, we will address harassment broadly, as well as racism, ableism, bullying, and sexual harassment. The United States’ Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines harassment as: [U]nwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy), national origin, older age (beginning at age 40), disability, or genetic information (including family medical history). Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.1 Although much harassment flies under the legal radar in terms of its overtness and frequency, each event has the potential for significant impact on the person on the receiving end of mistreatment and ought to be taken seriously. Federal and local governments dictate what is legal in workplaces. Spiritual communities must define for themselves what is considered harassment beyond the legal requirements of the workplace and how complaints will be handled. This will be defined by the community’s theology, ethics, and commitment to spiritual health and care for those who are more vulnerable (i.e., have fewer resources). Every community and institution needs to have an explicit harassment policy to protect its employees and community members from harm.

SECTION 1 40 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE Some may be familiar with the term microaggression, meaning the seemingly small, often accidental sleights that put down a person based on one or more aspects of their identity. These are things that would typically fall into the covert/no legal ramifications section of the above triangle. Notice, however, that the bulk of the triangle is made up of these events. People with power may want to write off these experiences as unintentional or inconsequential in size. However, the collective weight of so-called microaggressions is often unbearable to individuals and communities who experience them. For this reason, author Ibram X. Kendi advises against use of the term microaggression and instead favors referring to these events for what they are: abuse. Flipping this script—acknowledging the seriousness of these events—is one way in which people with more power can better recognize their impact over their intent, stop minimizing their behaviors, and elevate the seriousness of the everyday discrimination faced by their more vulnerable community members. Intent versus impact is a key concern when it comes to addressing harassment of all forms. Harassment occurs when someone with more power acts abusively toward someone with less power. Too often, the person with more power is allowed to get away with their abuse by saying, “I didn’t mean it that way.” “You’re making too big a deal of this.” “Don’t be so sensitive.” This allows people with power to avoid taking accountability for the ways their words and actions impact other people. If we are to take our power seriously, as well as our responsibility for caring for our communities, we must set intent (and ego) aside and take accountability for our impact instead. The task of leadership teams within spiritual communities is not only to set out clear anti- harassment policies, adhere to them, and adjudicate cases where they are violated. Community leaders also hold the responsibility to foster a culture of fair treatment where harassment is not tolerated, and when it does occur, the community comes around the complainant to hear their story, advocate for them, and offer support. Policies will need to cover both the legal protections of employees, volunteers, children, and vulnerable adults from all forms of unlawful harassment and also protect members of the community against lawful but still harmful boundary violations in the context of sacred community life. As you read through the following forms of harassment and accompanying case studies, remember that intersectionality is the interconnected nature of the aspects of one’s identity. It explains how people with multiple marginalized identities experience discrimination differently than those who share only one aspect of that person’s identity. For example, a Black gay man experiences racism differently than a Black straight man does and homophobia differently than a white gay man does. As good stewards of our power, we must be aware of the trap of thinking that we understand what it is like to live in someone else’s identity. We must intentionally practice both empathy and humility to hear how we can rectify any harassment or abuse experienced by a member of our community. Racial Harassment In US culture, white supremacy makes racism largely invisible to white people. And although harassment and abuse may not be intended, the impact is still very real. Leaders must ask ourselves, 1 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 41 have we created an environment in which people of color feel free to come forward and report racist abuse on any scale? More importantly, have we created a culture where white people routinely address racist abuse, removing that burden from people of color? And are we working to dismantle the structures and systems that uphold white supremacy? Tokenism is the practice of having just one or a few representative people of color in positions of leadership. This is a common function of racism, in which one person is expected to represent the interests, experiences, and culture of their entire race—or even all people of color. Tokenism occurs when a group of leaders is not truly representative of the community it serves. There is some awareness (and possibly embarrassment or shame) that the boardroom is too white—and so a small, non-representational number of people of color are invited into leadership positions to assuage white guilt. Tokenism hurts the individuals who are asked to carry too much. It is a form of discrimination by choosing someone for leadership based on the color of their skin and not the gifts that they bring to the table. It sends a message to the people of color in the community that their voices are not valued. It sends a message to the white people in the community that they can be complacent when it comes to talking about and addressing racism because there is a minimal level of representation in leadership. A small nonprofit organization has never had a director of color in their 30 years of operation, even though their clientele are 40% people of color. When a new position is created at the director level, the board is pleased when the executive director recruits and hires a Black woman, Jayden, to fill the role. Jayden is enthusiastic. She comes from a large publicly funded organization where she was in middle management. Now, as a director in a brand-new role, she gets to design a program from the ground up, hire her own team, and put her talent to good use. At first, the rest of the executive team are equally enthusiastic. They learn from Jayden some practical changes they can make to their hiring process that would welcome more recruits of color. They are pleased that the diversity of the staff increases under her leadership and that her program flourishes. Over time, however, Jayden begins to butt heads with her fellow directors. Her professional style is different from her colleagues in a number of ways. Her tone and volume are different. The way she interacts with her staff is different. The problems she identifies and addresses feel tiresome and overwhelming to her colleagues. The question arises as to whether Jayden is “culturally” a good fit for the organization and team. Questions for Reflection: • How would you name what is going on here? • If she worked in your organization, what avenues would be in place for Jayden to seek support above the level of the directors’ table? • Does your organization have access to and funding to pay trainers who are equipped to work with your staff to end racial harassment? • Do your board of directors and staff have direct access to one another, or is it up to the executive director to communicate about issues from one group to the other? SECTION 1 42 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE Ableism Ableism hides in plain sight for those who are not living with a disability. Being invited up to the front of the room to receive a blessing during a religious service may be no problem for someone who can navigate a row of chairs and one or two stairs. However, a person with limited eye-sight or who uses a cane, crutches, or a wheelchair may be prevented from participating. Religious entities are exempt from compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). So this is an area in which leadership will need to look beyond the legal requirements of accommodation and determine for themselves what ethical and theological standards will guide them. It is helpful to be cognizant of how our spaces and rituals could or could not be navigable for people with disabilities and to make adjustments on the front end. It is essential for those who are responsible for those spaces to respond with openness and understanding when limitations and oversights are pointed out to us.2 George, a man who uses a wheelchair, moves to a new neighborhood and is interested in worshiping at the local congregation of his mainline Protestant denomination. George calls ahead to the church office and is assured that he can access the building through a side entrance, as opposed to the main doors which are at the top of several stairs. George arrives one Sunday morning and follows the instructions he received. The side door does not have a button he can push to open the door. He wheels to the front of the building and waves at a greeter at the door and asks them for assistance. They are happy to help. Once inside, George sees the beautiful, historic sanctuary is full of built-in pews. He’s instructed to sit at the front of the side aisle and is assured that he won’t be in anyone’s way. He feels self-conscious as people navigate around him. And, as the sanctuary is much larger than the congregation, most people sit gathered toward the center aisle and he is in an area by himself. After the service, the coffee hour is held in a space upstairs. Unfortunately, the elevator is out of order, and after the priest apologizes profusely, George reassures her that it’s no problem, and goes home. Later in the week, the priest calls to apologize again and to explain that the church does prioritize serving people of all abilities. Unfortunately, they don’t have the funds to install push buttons for the doors or repair their elevator. When George points out that there also wasn’t a space for him in the sanctuary and that the order of worship had directions in it such as “all rise,” the priest becomes impatient with him and ends the call saying, “Well, we certainly enjoyed having you with us and hope you’ll worship with us again.” 2 Consulting with or hiring people with disabilities to assist you in making decisions or providing feedback on your policies, practices, and spaces will be most beneficial. If you have or form a committee to address disability issues in your community, be sure to include and prioritize people with disabilities on the committee. 1 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 43 Questions for Reflection: • What challenges would people with disabilities encounter in your community’s spaces and in the language/assumptions made in your gatherings? Or, which of these examples feels familiar to you? • How do your budget priorities align with making gatherings more accessible to more people? For example, could you easily redistribute funds to hire a sign-language interpreter if one was required? • What personal resistance or openness would you feel if a first-time visitor suggested remodeling your meeting space to make room for their wheelchair or moving your social hour to a different location in the building? Bullying Bullying can overlap with any other form of harassment, as it takes the form of intimidation or creating a hostile environment, which could entail sexual harassment, racist abuse, ableism, fatphobia, stereotyping, gaslighting, or any number of other areas. We recommend that communities develop culture statements or other ethical guidelines that name the behaviors that exemplify their core values. When behaviors can be held up against a shared rubric of how we want to be together, we can better identify and address bullying and intimidation. Consider the following forms bullying may take. What other forms of bullying would you add to this list? • Verbal and physical intimidation: When Georgia doesn’t get her way at work, she raises her voice, moves toward colleagues in a threatening manner, invading their personal space. Yesterday, she slammed the door and walked out of a meeting. • Financial bullying: David, the executive director of a synagogue, tells his bookkeeper, Lee, to misrepresent his spending in the board report and threatens to fire Lee if they don’t comply. Lee and their family have also recently become members of the congregation. • Cyberbullying: A dharma student, Ray, sends another student, Tim (a peer), explicit emails, sharing memes and jokes of a sexual nature. When Tim asks Ray to stop, Ray starts sending messages to Tim’s spouse on social media, asking, “What’s going on with Tim? I thought we were friends, but he told me to leave him alone.” And, “I didn’t know you two were such prudes, I’m just joking!” • Spiritual abuse: Pastor Luis counsels Julia, a congregant, against divorce, saying, “you made a vow before God to honor your husband. God brought the two of you together for a reason.” Questions for Reflection: • Do any of these examples make you think, “That would never happen here”? Why do you think your community is exempt from that issue? • When have you witnessed someone being a bully and didn’t address it? What did you feel? What was your self-talk? What do you need in order to be able to respond differently next time? • Do you have an ethics statement for your community? What would you want to have in it? Does your community have a culture of kindly but firmly calling people to abide by your adopted statement? SECTION
