104 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE • Designate an advocate for the complainant, i.e. someone who helps the complainant navigate the system and who clearly acts in their interest rather than the institution’s interest (See Appendix: “The Role of the Advocate” by Laura Sider Jost) • Be an educational resource to the local congregation or organization where the accused was employed to provide support and education about the nature of abuse by spiritual leaders. 3. Investigation Team (See “Complaint > Investigation > Adjudication” below) This is a separate person or persons whose job it is to gather information regarding the allegations of the complaint. Preferably, this is an outside consultant with expertise (a legal background would be helpful; a background in clinical therapy would not necessarily be helpful) who can come in, interview the appropriate people, request possible evidence (e.g. calendars, emails), organize this information, and present it to the Adjudication Committee of the judicatory or organization. This person would be compensated for their services. The fact that they would have no association with individuals in the judicatory would be an advantage in minimizing possible bias. They would not be serving as legal counsel. To carry out this task, you may decide to appoint individuals within the judicatory or organization as volunteers. • Advantage: No expense. • Disadvantages: It’s asking a lot of your volunteers/staff, and they probably won’t have the expertise needed to accomplish the task. (See “Investigator Role” below) 4. Adjudication Committee (See “Complaint > Investigation > Adjudication” below) This is the group of persons who are formally authorized within a judicatory or organization to hear the evidence, adjudicate (i.e. decide the validity or non-validity of the complaint), and then make recommendations regarding discipline, exoneration, or other action. This committee should correspond with the persons who already have the authority and responsibility to grant or remove credentials of authorized spiritual leaders. Within the seminary or nonprofit, it should likewise be those who have responsibility for hiring and firing. Some organizations already have a structure in place for a judicial review or trial. Their authority and responsibility are usually clearly laid out. The most important thing about the Adjudication Committee’s role is that everyone is clear that it is only up to this body to “adjudicate” the complaint, i.e. to decide whether they believe the allegations are true and are covered by your policy. (See “Best Practice Checklist for Policy and Procedures” below) This adjudication task is not up to the investigator, the Response Team, the Executive, the insurance company, a therapist, or legal counsel. The simple question the Adjudication Committee is trying to answer is: 3 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 105 Did the accused spiritual leaders engage in conduct that violates the policy that established ethical standards for them? Intentions, rationalizations, explanations, or extenuating circumstances are fundamentally irrelevant to the adjudication process. 5. Legal Counsel Legal counsel can be a vital resource in responding to a complaint, but only if both the lawyer and the institution are clear about roles and expectations. Too often in the past, a judicatory, seminary, or organization has turned to their lawyer to “handle this,” which has resulted in the lawyer assuming their role is to protect the assets of the institution from the complainant. Ultimately, this has not served the real or perceived interests of the judicatory, seminary, or organization. Your process in response to a complaint of spiritual leader misconduct should be driven by: • Your goal to protect the integrity of the ministerial/teaching relationship and to protect those who may be vulnerable • Your commitment to a fair and just process • Your theology, ethics, and values to interrupt harm and to confront injustice • A commitment to support those who have been harmed by one of your leaders with justice and healing • A commitment to call to behavioral change and accountability for those who have done harm A CAUTIONARY NOTE As we have seen in recent cases, judicatories, seminaries, or organizations are often found liable for significant sums of money in addition to lawyers’ fees. In most cases, these costs are unnecessary if the institution had simply stayed focused on the goals listed above. A lawyer who is experienced and well-informed and who has a clear mandate from their client (the institution) can save you a lot of money and help do the right thing, which ultimately serves the long-term interests of your judicatory or seminary. If you hire an attorney, you should be hiring them to help you implement these goals, using your policy and procedures to be sure that you are careful in your process and that the outcome has integrity. (See Appendix: “Sexual Misconduct in Spiritual Communities: A Lawyer’s Perspective” by Carol Merchasin) SECTION 3 106 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE If, on the other hand, you “turn this problem over to counsel,” they will not be implementing these goals, which will mean: • Denying pastoral contact with the complainant • Withholding information • Denying any acknowledgment of a finding that the complaint is held valid • Denying restitution All of these responses greatly increase the likelihood that the complainant/victim will not find what they need and deserve from the judicatory, seminary, or organization (See “Elements of Justice-making” above) and will therefore have no choice but to pursue civil litigation. 6. Therapist/Consultant A judicatory committee or organizational leaders may decide it wants to consult with a therapist as part of its process. The question is why? What role are you asking that person to play? Sometimes the committee wants the accused, who may be denying the allegations, to be evaluated by a therapist to determine if they are an abuser. This is a mistake. Therapists who have expertise in boundary violations and abuse will generally refuse to play this role. Having a therapist evaluate the accused is an attempt to avoid having to consider the evidence and adjudicate the complaint. Additionally, there is no psychological profile or test that can be administered by a therapist to determine whether or not a spiritual leader is capable or likely to violate boundaries. Of course, there are diagnostic tests for mental health conditions and other disorders, but results of these tests will not tell us if the accused minister did or did not do what is being accused of them. A CAUTIONARY NOTE Do not try to use a therapist to help determine whether an allegation is true, i.e. whether these events actually happened. You are not trying to determine whether the accused spiritual leader has a personality making them likely to violate boundaries. You are trying to determine if they violated boundaries and violated your policy. 3 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 107 In the disciplinary phase (after adjudication), a judicatory may consider requiring therapeutic work on the part of the abuser in order to be considered for reinstatement as a minister or teacher. A competent, experienced therapist may agree to take this on if the perpetrator fully and unequivocally acknowledges the misconduct and takes responsibility for it. This evaluation is then to determine what kind of abuser they are and whether or not therapy would be helpful. If the abuser is a wanderer, therapy may be a useful rehabilitative resource. However, if they are a predator, therapy will be of little value to change behavior. 7. Insurance Agent If your judicatory, seminary, or organization has insurance regarding professional malfeasance, which it should have, then notify your insurance agency immediately once a complaint is filed. (See “Best Practice Checklist for Policy and Procedures” below) The same principle applies here that we discussed above in regard to legal counsel. Do not drop the complaint in the insurer’s lap with the directive to “handle this.” Be clear ahead of time about how you expect to work with the insurer. You have insurance so that you can afford to provide for the material needs of those who have been harmed by a spiritual leader. If you have coverage for a complaint, the insurer should help to compensate the victim for pain and suffering experienced. This sum will generally be far less than the settlement reached as a result of a civil suit. SECTION 3 RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 109 Investigator Role If you decide to conduct the investigation of misconduct in-house, rather than using a third-party investigator, follow these best practices. Inviting People to be Interviewed • Solicit people to be interviewed via an invitation on your website, internal newsletter, and/or other appropriate places; indicate a deadline by which interviews must be scheduled. • Set up an email address to accept inquiries and decide who will be responsible for monitoring the email; consider an auto-reply so that people know their message was received. • Review with the interviewee the parameters of confidentiality that will apply to the interview; answer their questions with transparency and sensitivity • Timely responses are crucial. Facilitating the Interview Process • Interviewers – Decide if you will have one or two people at each interview, and do your best to be consistent throughout the process (If you have two people, it can be helpful to assign a primary note taker, time keeper, etc); be aware of interpersonal dynamics between interviewer and interviewee • Setting – choose a neutral setting conducive to sensitive conversations that will protect the confidentiality of the interviewee. If possible, it can be helpful to provide two appropriate and achievable location options, and let the interviewee choose which they prefer. • Time – plan for 1 hour; make additional appointments if necessary. Give yourself time afterward to organize your notes and process information. Do not book back-to-back interviews. • Transparency – be open about the function and limitations of your role, the organization’s process, and what’s next. • No surprises – keep the interviewee apprised of any changes to your appointment (e.g. will a different member of the committee than originally planned be conducting the interview?) and do your best to stick to the plan you have outlined with them. • Confidentiality – be clear about the parameters of confidentiality in the interview process, answer questions about this from the interviewee; demonstrate your commitment to confidentiality throughout the interview. Interviewing the Complainant(s) • Review the principles of trauma-informed responses. SECTION 3 110 FAITHTRUST INSTITUTE • Do not rush or interrupt them; be an active listener and an active interviewer. • Invite the complainant to share as much specific and corroborating information as possible (times, dates, documentation, etc.). • Thank them for sharing their experiences and trusting you with their story. Interviewing the Accused • Always have two people; do not conduct this interview alone. • Be prepared for the accused’s initial minimization or denial of the accusations. • Do not be thwarted by the accused’s threats to sue the community for loss of livelihood or slander. • Focus the interview on the allegations of misconduct, and not on the accused’s feelings of being “victimized.” • Be fair and neutral; do not negotiate or make deals with the accused leader. • Do not allow the accused to resign and give up credentials before the adjudication. • Do not minimize or add your own personal commentary to the accusations or complaints. • Do remember that unequivocal accountability is the best means to bring an abusing spiritual leader to account. • Thank them for participating in this process and sharing their responses with you. Responding to Emotions • Those you interview may express a variety of emotions: anger, sadness, confusion, blame, shame, disbelief, and/or mistrust (of you and/or the process). • Show empathy while staying fair and neutral. • Practice critical self-awareness; be mindful of your strengths and sensitivities. Considerations for Interview Questions • In general, your questions should provide information on the behaviors and patterns of the accused, information about the community’s culture and norms, and any information that the interviewee deems relevant. • Remember, the adjudicating committee is going to rely on information from interviews to determine: did the alleged behavior take place and, if so, does it violate our policy? • Your questions should not violate the confidentiality of the complainant or accused. • Open-ended and closed-ended questions both serve an important purpose (e.g. “What would you like to share with us today?” and “Has [accused] ever asked to borrow money from you before?” are both good questions). 3 NOITCES RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 111 • Always, always be prepared to learn new information that may expand or complicate the original complaint. Taking Notes • Non-judgmental tone  Do: “EC stated her relationship with Edward confused her a lot because he would always change his story, and be hot and cold.”  Don’t: “EC seemed confused and didn’t usually understand what her teacher was saying to her.” • Avoid Conclusions  Do: “EC apologized for crying and was silent for a couple minutes.”  Don’t: “EC was upset and couldn’t finish her story.” • Using quotations  Do: “EC said, ’He asked me to come over right away and I thought it was an emergency. When I came in, he told me I looked beautiful and he gave me some tea. After that, he groped my breast and kissed me.’”  Don’t: “EC said that he touched private parts of her body and made a pass at her.” SECTION 3 RESPONDING TO SPIRITUAL LEADER MISCONDUCT 113 Best Practice Checklist for Policy and Procedures Policy  Does policy state your community’s ETHICAL MANDATE of why these issues matter?  Does policy include a STATEMENT OF PURPOSE?

We may be given information in confidence, which means that we are entrusted with overseeing that information. There may be circumstances that require that we disclose or discuss this information. For example, if a student shares a personal crisis, we may need to consult with a colleague about how best to support this person. We do not need to disclose names or particulars in order to get the assistance we need to be helpful to someone else. A secret means not disclosing any information regardless of the context. For example, we are planning a surprise birthday party for a colleague, and it’s a secret. The questions in regard to confidentiality are with whom do we need to share information and what information do we share in order to carry out our pastoral and ethical responsibilities? In responding to a complaint of misconduct, the process should be confidential, but not secret. Confidentiality is intended to protect the process, but once the process is completed, people need to know what happened. This ensures the integrity of the process. Confidentiality is never intended to protect a spiritual leader who is found guilty of misconduct from the consequences of their actions. In the process, information should be shared on a “need to know” basis. Who needs to know that an investigation of this particular spiritual leader is going on? The accused, the leadership of the congregation, organization, or seminary where this person is employed, the complainant, and the organizational leadership. Who needs to know the identity of the complainant(s)? Probably only the accused and the members of the adjudicating committee, unless the complainant wants to self- disclose in other settings, which is their right. The expectation that the accused spiritual leader not disclose or discuss the identities of the complaint(s) may need to be made clear to them. Too often we have seen the accused name the complainant(s) and proceed to trash them in the community as part of their effort to derail the investigation. Post-adjudication, if the complaint is upheld, the identity of the spiritual leader needs to be shared with the appropriate people, including the congregation, the judicatory, the organization, and the denomination/movement/lineage. The identity of the survivors does not need to be shared unless they so choose. In addition, survivors should not be asked to agree to a gag rule as a condition of resolution. This does not help with their healing process. It was their experience of abuse, and they should be free to talk about it. SECTION
