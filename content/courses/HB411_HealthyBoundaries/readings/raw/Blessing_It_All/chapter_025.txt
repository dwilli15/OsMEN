For Assisted Conception Rev. Jennifer Gracen Dedicated to Virginia Gracen and the child we created together This ritual is designed for the individual(s) hoping to conceive a child through procedures such as intracervical insemination, intrauterine insemination, or in vitro fertilization. Planned conception, however it is achieved, may require many attempts over several months or years. This brief ritual is offered to bring intentionality and spiritual focus to each attempt. Materials □ Candle □ Optional: Seed, such as an acorn, and something to plant it in Setup You can do this ritual either at home, before you leave for the place where the conception attempt will happen (if it does not also happen at home), or in the place where it will happen. Medical facilities may not allow you to light a candle; you could use a battery-operated one, use a seed instead, or do the ritual outside the facility before entering. If possible, make the space comfortable and easeful. Script (Light the candle or hold the seed. If you are intending to become pregnant alone, you can place a hand on your abdomen. If a partner or support person is with you, they can place their hand on your abdomen. If you are working with a surrogate and they are willing to be touched in this way, you can place a hand on their abdomen. Change “I” to “we” in the script as appropriate for your circumstances.) Spirit of Life and Love, I invite you into this moment As I strive to bring new life Into this world. I welcome the miracle of life Into my life. May I be open to the possibilities. May I be open to the questions. May I be open to the love. Be with me in this and all moments. Amen. (Extinguish the candle and allow the smoke to rise for a moment. If you are using a seed, consider planting it.)
