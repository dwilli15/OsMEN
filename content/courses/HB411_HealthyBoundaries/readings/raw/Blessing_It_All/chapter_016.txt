For the Union of More Than Two Partners Rev. Lyn Cox This ritual includes an exchange of vows and other elements solemnizing a lifetime commitment between any number of partners. It is similar to a two-partner wedding, but is especially designed for partnerships of three or more people practicing ethical nonmonogamy. The version here is written for three people, but it can be adapted for more. The author is a UU minister who has been a resource to colleagues on ethical nonmonogamy in Unitarian Universalism since 2003. Materials □ Altar table □ Clear jar with lid for sand ceremony □ Decorative sand in four different colors (one for the base, one for each partner) □ Clear vases or other pourable vessels to hold each color of sand □ Two rings for each partner □ Table or music stand from which the partners can read their vows Setup People who practice ethical nonmonogamy connect with their partners and metamours (the other partners of their partners) in many different ways; they organize their relationships in many different configurations. But in all cases, the core values of ethical nonmonogamy include honesty, consent, listening, communication, consideration, and respect. This ceremony is designed for people who consider one another primary partners and are making a lifetime commitment to one another. This is not to say that such an arrangement is the best or the default, simply that this is one possible constellation of people who may be seeking such a ceremony. Adapt the text offered here to suit the people you are working with. Go through the script with the partners beforehand and personalize it as needed, including asking them to help phrase the statement of intentions, to choose a reading and a person to read it, to decide whether they will exchange rings or some other symbol or token, and to decide how they will refer to one another in their vows. The ceremony is written with the partners’ names in the same order throughout, but you and they may wish to vary the order. Rehearse the ceremony with the participants in advance, in the space where it will take place. (If you rehearse pouring the sand for the sand ceremony, use only one color of sand—or no sand at all, with partners just rehearsing the motions of pouring.) Set up the altar table with the clear jar in advance, and pour a layer of the base sand color into it. Set each partner’s colored sand near the main jar, in a container that will be easy to pour from. Have the rings in a secure but easily accessible location, and ensure that you and all participants have your scripts if you need them. Script Opening Words and Statement of Intentions Dear ones, we are gathered together for the joyful and spiritual purpose of joining together these three people in a covenant of commitment. These beloveds, [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3], will make vows and participate in rituals today as a testament to the abundance of their love and the centrality their partnership has in their lives. The joys of life are multiplied, the sorrows of life more sustainably held, and the mysteries of life more deeply explored with the companionship of those who have promised to share those things with one another. By joining their lives in this ceremony, [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] are recognizing the mutual responsibilities, deep respect, and room for growth that come with life partnership. [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3], may you enter into this next phase of your life partnership with abundance in all of the things that help you sustain commitment: trust, patience, creativity, and love. You have not come with an expectation of uninterrupted and eternal bliss, nor with a demand that anyone make themselves smaller; you recognize and bring reverence to the work and play of daily life, the need for resourcefulness, and the mysteries of growing as individuals and as partners alongside one another. Have I properly expressed the intention you bring to this partnership, the spirit of your union, and the purposes you have in bringing us together today? P ARTNERS: You have. Acknowledgment of Families The values [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] bring to their partnership, and the encouragement that will lead them to strengthen it over time, are nourished by the wisdom and love that you, dearly beloved, have provided and continue to provide by being here today. In particular, [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] mentioned their families [specify “chosen families” and/or “families of origin” as appropriate] as sources of support and understanding as they have learned how to build their lives together. Your past influence and ongoing love will help sustain them in the years ahead. If the partners are raising children As we lift up the love that [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] have for one another, we also honor that the bond they affirm today makes a family of [number] people. [Children’s names] are also held in this union and celebrated in this ceremony. May this family provide the strength and support that each member needs to grow into the fullness of their being. Reading To help express their feelings on this occasion, [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] have selected a reading about love. I invite [identify the reader: “their friend Kai,” “[Name]’s mother Charl,” etc.] forward to offer the reading. (The partners should choose a reading that feels appropriate to their relationship. Some possibilities include:) • “A New Constellation” (Marge Piercy) from The Moon Is Always Female • “Hug O’War” (Shel Silverstein) from Where the Sidewalk Ends • “How to Fall in Love with the World” (Jess Reynolds) from Love Like Thunder • “Love Is Becoming a Safe Word” (adrienne maree brown) from her website Sand Ceremony A lifetime commitment includes both togetherness and individuality. Partners encourage one another to be their best individual selves, even as they come together as a family. By joining together, [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] pledge to continue growing as people, to recognize one another’s unique needs and gifts, and to honor the ways their hearts are forever mingled. [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] will symbolize this pledge with sand art. At the bottom of the glass jar, there is already some sand, a foundation of friendship and shared values that this family will build on. [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] will add layers of sand, each in a different color, symbolizing their individuality. Yet, once the sand art is complete, the combination of colors forms a pattern more complex and beautiful than any of the colors could make alone. Nor can one color be removed without affecting the others and altering the pattern, just as each partner matters to your union. I invite you now to pour your sands into the glass jar, one at a time. (Each partner takes a turn adding a layer of their sand to the jar. They may wish to pour several times each, creating multiple layers. When they have finished, put the lid on the jar.) Sustaining a family is everyday work, as common as sand. Yet when we step back, we see the sparkle and variation that makes this mission into a miracle. May this art be for you a symbol of the balance of unity and individuality, a place to begin on the shores of a vast ocean of love. Prayer I invite you to join me now in opening our hearts to the sacred, our bodies to stillness, and our minds to centering in this very moment. Spirit of Life and Love, known by many names and yet fully known by none, our hearts lift in a chorus of blessing for [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] and the commitment they solemnize today. May they resonate with the love and support with which we surround them. May they know harmony in the blending of their individual voices, and may they know serenity in their times of rest. When there is joy, may it rise to the rafters and bring joy to others. When there is struggle, may we join together with them in songs of persistence. Eternal one of blessing, accompany [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] through their shared life, in echoes of the past bringing wisdom and in voices from the future calling them onward. May it be so. Exchange of Vows [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3], before I ask you each to make your vow, I ask you each to affirm your intentions, one at a time. [Name 1], do you accept [Name 2] and [Name 3] completely as life partners, committed to love, to care for and be cared for by, to sustain in sickness and in health, to grieve with in sorrow and to celebrate with in joy, from this day forth? P ARTNER 1: I do. (Repeat for the other partners.) L EADER: The vows through which you affirm your life partnership are only one sign of your dedication to each other as individuals and to your family as a whole. The consideration, listening, patience, service, and commitment that you practice every day are what will bring meaning to these vows. I ask you to join hands in a circle and face each other as you exchange your vows. (The partners may, if the ceremony space and their mobility needs allow, choose to rotate the circle as each one speaks, such that the partner who is speaking faces the congregation as well as their partners. They may prefer to read their vows from a table or music stand in the center of the circle or to repeat after you.) Partner 1: I, [Name 1], join with you, [Name 2], and you, [Name 3], as my [partners, spouses, life mates, etc.]. I pledge to be truthful, openhearted, and supportive in word and deed. I vow to honor each of you and our family as a whole by keeping our agreements. I promise to cherish each of you and to encourage your individual well-being, as well as the health of our partnership. I will sustain this covenant through all of the changes in our lives from this day forward. (Repeat for the other partners.) Ring Ceremony As a sign of your partnership, you have chosen the gift of rings, two for each partner to wear, an embrace of the hand from each of your other partners. A ring is a circle. A circle can symbolize an embrace, a gateway, the cycle of life, a renewal of the spirit. All of these things can be found in a living and loving partnership. In a multipartner family, rings may remind you of ebb and flow, the support that flows in many directions, not merely back and forth but swirling and surging among you all, in a network of care. May the endlessness of the circle lead you to move with courage in the world and with peace in your family. May these rings be blessed by the Spirit of Love and be true symbols of love for all the years of your lives. [Name 1], please bestow a ring on each of your partners and repeat after me. (Read the following text line by line, pausing after each to let the partner repeat what you have said.) [Name 2] and [Name 3], I give you these rings as signs of my devotion. The center of the circle is as open as my heart. The completeness of the circle is as endless as my love. (Repeat for the other partners.) Pronouncement of Union (Turn toward the gathered community.) Now that [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3] have committed to one another their love and devotion, and have made a public pledge of their covenant, I declare that they are now [life partners, spouses, life mates, bound in holy union, etc.]. May their partnership be long sustained in love and happiness. (Turn toward the partners.) You may now kiss one another [or show affection in some other way]. Closing Words And now, with confidence in the spirit and practice of abundant love, we send you forth to build a life together of beauty, warmth, and understanding. May the truth and trust that you show to one another bring you strength. May your love and your partnership endure as a grace upon this world. Go in peace. Return to one another in love. So be it.
