## Email 1: Introduction & Course Engagement

**Send Date:** Monday, August 25, 2025

**Subject:** Reflections on Boundary Frameworks - Excited for This Journey

---

Dear Dr. House,

I hope this message finds you well after our first two weeks of class. I wanted to reach out to share how engaged I am with the material we've been exploring.

Tawwab's framework for the six types of boundaries has already shifted how I think about my own ministerial practice. Her distinction between physical, emotional, time, sexual, intellectual, and material boundaries provides a vocabulary I didn't realize I was missing. I found myself particularly drawn to her point about how "unclear boundaries lead to resentment" (Tawwab, ch. 2) — this resonates with patterns I've observed in congregational settings.

Fortune's "Joy of Boundaries" framing was also illuminating. The reframe from boundaries as restriction to boundaries as liberation aligns well with my theological understanding of freedom as responsibility to self and community.

I'm curious about a connection I'm making between the fiduciary duty concept from Stephens and the notion of "sacred trust." Do you see these as overlapping frameworks, or do they address different aspects of ministerial responsibility?

Thank you for creating such a rich learning environment. I look forward to the intensive session later this week.

Warmly,

## Email 2: Integration & Healing

**Send Date:** Monday, September 8, 2025

**Subject:** Hemphill's Vision of Transformative Healing

---

Dear Dr. House,

I continue to appreciate the depth of our course readings. Hemphill's *What It Takes to Heal* has been particularly transformative for me.

Her argument that "healing is not about returning to who we were before" but rather about transformation into something new challenges the pastoral instinct to "fix" or "restore." I found the connection she draws between individual healing and collective/systemic change especially compelling — it moves beyond individualistic self-help toward what she calls "healing as political practice."

I'm wrestling with how to hold both the intimate, pastoral care aspects of boundary-setting alongside Hemphill's larger systemic vision. In your experience, how do leaders maintain awareness of both micro and macro dimensions of boundaries?

The interview you assigned with Ijeoma Oluo was also powerful. When Hemphill discusses how trauma lives in our bodies and our relationships (around minute 38-42), I recognized patterns in my own embodied responses to stress.

I'm beginning to see connections between these readings and my final project ideas. Would office hours be a good time to discuss preliminary concepts?

With gratitude,

## Email 3: Self and Systems

**Send Date:** Monday, September 22, 2025

**Subject:** Cooper-White and the Relational Self

---

Dear Dr. House,

As we approach the Guiding Document paper deadline, I wanted to share how Cooper-White's *Shared Wisdom* has deepened my understanding of the self in pastoral care.

Her psychodynamic framework for understanding the "use of self" challenges me to consider my own countertransference patterns more carefully. The expanded 20th anniversary edition's attention to trauma-informed care connects beautifully with our earlier Hemphill readings.

I'm particularly interested in Cooper-White's discussion of "parallel process" — how the dynamics between pastor and parishioner often mirror dynamics within the congregation. This has implications for my Guiding Document analysis: I'm examining how our denominational code of ethics implicitly assumes an individualistic model of pastoral care while our theological tradition emphasizes communal discernment.

Do you see tension between psychodynamic (individual) and systemic (communal) approaches to boundaries, or do you experience them as complementary?

I'm also noting how Sharp's "Crossing Borders with Healthy Boundaries" brings important cross-cultural considerations that weren't centered in some of our earlier readings. This intersects with my own context of [ministry setting].

Thank you for the space to process these ideas.

Best,

## Email 4: Trauma-Informed Leadership

**Send Date:** Monday, October 6, 2025

**Subject:** Pasquale and Religious Trauma

---

Dear Dr. House,

Pasquale's *Sacred Wounds* arrived at a significant moment in my reading journey. After exploring systemic perspectives, her deeply personal account of religious trauma and recovery has grounded the theoretical in the lived.

Her concept of "sacred wounds" — the particular harm that occurs when the wound comes from a trusted spiritual community — provides crucial language for pastoral care. I appreciated her vulnerability in sharing her own journey alongside practical guidance for recovery.

I submitted my Project Synopsis yesterday and am now moving toward the research phase. I'm planning to focus on [topic], examining how [specific angle]. Pasquale's work has reinforced for me that theoretical frameworks must always remain connected to embodied, lived experience.

The supplementary reading from Tawwab on "Trauma and Boundaries" (Chapter 8) paired well with Pasquale. The combination of clinical insight and spiritual wisdom feels like exactly what ministry leaders need.

I'm looking forward to our async week — it will provide space for deeper engagement with these texts while preparing for the presentation phase.

With appreciation,

## Email 5: Technology and Boundaries

**Send Date:** Monday, October 27, 2025

**Subject:** Reflections on Technology Presentations

---

Dear Dr. House,

Last week's presentations on Haidt's *The Anxious Generation* sparked important conversations that I'm still processing.

The data on the correlation between smartphone adoption and adolescent mental health decline is sobering. What struck me most was the discussion of how technology doesn't just affect individual boundaries but reshapes the very possibility of certain kinds of communal formation. Haidt's four "foundational harms" framework (social deprivation, sleep deprivation, attention fragmentation, addiction) has me reconsidering our congregation's relationship with technology.

The presentation group did excellent work connecting Haidt's concerns to ministry contexts. Their exploration of digital boundaries for religious leaders — when to be "available" via text, how to handle social media relationships with congregants — addresses real challenges I face.

For my own presentation next week on [Ross/Murthy], I'm thinking about how to connect the themes of conflict/connection to our ongoing conversation about boundaries. The Tawwab Part 2 material on "Boundary-Setting in Practice" will be useful grounding.

Thank you for structuring the course to move from theoretical foundations toward practical navigation.

Gratefully,

## Email 6: Connection and Community

**Send Date:** Monday, November 10, 2025

**Subject:** Murthy and the Ministry of Presence

---

Dear Dr. House,

As we enter the final phase of the semester, I'm reflecting on how the readings have built toward Murthy's vision in *Together*.

His account of loneliness as a public health crisis reframes much of what we've discussed. Boundaries, in this light, aren't just about protection from harm but about creating the conditions for genuine connection. His three dimensions of loneliness (intimate, relational, collective) map onto different aspects of ministry.

What struck me about last week's presentations was the tension between Ross's call for "calling in" vs. the reality that boundary violations sometimes require clear separation. How do we hold both repair/accountability AND protection/safety? This feels like a core question for ministry ethics.

My final project is taking shape. I'm focusing on [specific topic] and have gathered sources from our course readings plus [additional research]. The presentation on [date] will preview my main argument about [thesis].

I'm grateful for this learning community. The integration of psychological, theological, and sociological perspectives has enriched my understanding of boundaries as essential to flourishing ministry.

Looking forward to our remaining sessions.

With warm regards,

## Email 7: Final Reflection

**Send Date:** Monday, November 24, 2025

**Subject:** Gratitude and Integration

---

Dear Dr. House,

As I submit my final paper today, I wanted to express my gratitude for this transformative course.

When I began HB411, I understood boundaries primarily as rules to follow — professional guidelines to prevent misconduct. Through our readings and discussions, I've come to understand boundaries as dynamic practices that enable authentic, caring relationships.

Key integrations from my learning:

1. **From Tawwab**: Boundaries are acts of self-love that paradoxically enable deeper love of others
2. **From Hemphill**: Personal and collective healing are interconnected
3. **From Cooper-White**: Self-awareness is an ethical obligation, not self-indulgence
4. **From Pasquale**: Religious communities can wound and heal
5. **From Fortune/Sawyer**: Structural supports make individual boundary-keeping possible
6. **From Haidt/Murthy/Ross**: Contemporary challenges require contemporary wisdom

My final project on [topic] represents my attempt to integrate these perspectives into [application]. I hope it honors the complexity of the issues while remaining practically useful.

Thank you for your guidance, your scholarship, and your modeling of what boundaried presence looks like in practice.

With deep appreciation,
