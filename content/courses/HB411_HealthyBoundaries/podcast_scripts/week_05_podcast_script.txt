[SEGMENT 1: INTRODUCTION - 3 minutes]
[MUSIC: Theme music fades in, warm and welcoming]

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

Welcome back to Healthy Boundaries for Leaders, the podcast companion to HB411. I'm Dr. Sarah Chen, and I'm so glad you're here for Week 5: Myths and Types of Boundaries.

Setting boundaries is selfish. Boundaries hurt relationships. If I were really spiritual, I wouldn't need boundaries. Sound familiar? Let's bust some myths.

This week's readings include Cloud & Townsend Chapter 5, Tawwab Chapter 4. If you haven't had a chance to complete the readings yet, don't worry—this podcast will give you the key insights, though I do encourage you to engage with the full texts when you can.

Joining me today, as always, are my wonderful co-hosts: Rev. Marcus Thompson, bringing the ministry and pastoral perspective, and Dr. Elena Rodriguez, our licensed counselor who helps us understand the psychological dimensions.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

Great to be here, Sarah. Week 5 is one I've been looking forward to because myths and types of boundaries touches so many people in ministry.

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

Absolutely. In my practice, I see these themes come up constantly. The concepts we'll cover today—debunking myths, guilt and boundaries, types of boundaries—these are foundational to healthy functioning.

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

Let's dive in. Remember, you can pause at any time if you need to reflect or take notes. This journey is yours, and there's no rushing it.

[MUSIC: Theme music fades out]


[SEGMENT 2: CORE CONCEPTS - 8 minutes]

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

Let's unpack the core concepts from this week's readings. Myths and Types of Boundaries might sound straightforward, but there's real depth here that we need to explore together.

Myth: Boundaries are selfish.
Reality: Boundaries are essential for genuine love. You cannot give what you don't have, and you cannot have yourself if you have no boundaries.

Myth: If I set boundaries, I'll lose relationships.
Reality: You may lose unhealthy relationships. Healthy relationships can handle boundaries—in fact, they require them.

Myth: Spiritual people don't need boundaries.
Reality: God has boundaries. Jesus had boundaries. Boundaries are part of mature faith.


The myth that hurt Emily most was "If I set boundaries, people will abandon me." This belief came from childhood, when her love was indeed conditional on compliance. Set a boundary, lose the relationship—that was the unspoken rule.

As an adult, Emily tested this belief. She started setting small boundaries—declining an invitation, expressing a preference, saying "I need time to think about that" instead of immediately agreeing. And you know what happened?

Some people left. That was hard but clarifying. Those relationships were built on Emily's compliance, not on mutual respect.

But many people stayed. And those relationships deepened. Emily discovered that the people who could handle her boundaries were the people worth keeping. The myth was only partially true: boundaries do cost some relationships, but they cost the wrong relationships while making space for the right ones.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

You know, Sarah, in my years of ministry, I've seen how common boundary myths affects not just individuals but entire communities. When leaders don't understand these principles, it ripples outward. Churches, organizations, families—they all suffer when boundaries aren't understood.

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

That's such an important point, Marcus. The research supports this too. Studies show that leaders with healthy boundary awareness create healthier organizational cultures. It's not just personal—it's systemic. Your individual boundary work has collective implications.

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

That systemic element is crucial. We're not just doing this work for ourselves. The boundaries we model shape what others believe is possible. Our children watch us. Our colleagues observe us. Our congregations learn from us.

Let's look at each of this week's key concepts in more depth:

**Debunking Myths**

This foundational idea helps us understand that boundaries aren't walls—they're more like property lines. They define where you end and others begin. Without this clarity, we lose ourselves in relationships or become isolated from meaningful connection. Think about it: when you know where your property ends, you can be a good neighbor. You know what's yours to tend and what belongs to someone else. The same is true emotionally.

**Guilt And Boundaries**

Building on that foundation, we see how guilt and boundaries connects to our ability to function in relationships. This isn't about being rigid or harsh—it's about having clear enough boundaries that we can actually be present with others. Paradoxically, good boundaries enable deeper intimacy. When I know where I end, I can truly encounter where you begin.

**Types Of Boundaries**

And here's where it gets practical. Understanding types of boundaries gives us tools we can actually use in daily life. This is where the rubber meets the road. Theory is important, but transformation happens in the moments when we actually apply what we're learning.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

What I appreciate about this week's readings is how they connect theory to practice. It's not enough to understand boundaries intellectually—we have to live them. Head knowledge becomes heart knowledge through practice.

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

And that practice often feels uncomfortable at first. I tell my clients: if boundary-setting felt easy, you'd already be doing it. The discomfort is actually a sign that you're growing into new territory.


[SEGMENT 3: EXPERT DISCUSSION - 5 minutes]

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

Let's hear from our experts. Marcus, from your ministry experience, what stands out to you about this week's material on myths and types of boundaries?

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

You know, Sarah, I think about common boundary myths constantly in pastoral work. So many ministry leaders struggle here. They give and give until there's nothing left, thinking that's what faithfulness requires. But that's not biblical—that's burnout waiting to happen.

The guilt around boundaries in ministry is real. I had a senior pastor tell me that setting boundaries felt like abandoning his flock. We had to reframe it: 'A dead shepherd can't protect anyone.'

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

That resonates deeply with what I see clinically. There's often a hero complex underneath poor boundaries—this belief that we have to save everyone, that taking care of ourselves means abandoning others.

Cognitive behavioral therapy works well with boundary myths because they're essentially cognitive distortions. 'I must be available always' is an irrational belief. When we examine it, it crumbles under scrutiny.

Debunking Myths connects to attachment patterns formed early in life. If you learned that your worth depended on meeting others' needs, setting boundaries feels like risking abandonment. But here's the truth: people who can't handle your boundaries can't handle your wholeness.

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

That's powerful. "People who can't handle your boundaries can't handle your wholeness." Can you say more about that?

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

When you set a boundary, you're essentially saying, "I'm a separate person with my own needs and limits." Some people will find that threatening. They preferred the version of you that was always available, always accommodating, always saying yes.

The loss of those relationships is real and painful. But what you're gaining is the possibility of genuine relationships—ones based on mutual respect rather than your depletion.

Here's what I tell my clients: The people who leave when you set boundaries were only there for what you gave them. The people who stay when you set boundaries are there for who you are. That's a trade worth making, even when it hurts.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

In faith terms, we'd say you're exchanging counterfeit intimacy for genuine community. It's a hard trade in the short term, but it's the only path to actual connection. Scripture is full of this pattern—letting go of the false to grasp the true.

Jesus himself modeled this. He withdrew from crowds who wanted more from him. He said no to legitimate requests. He maintained his sense of mission even when others wanted him to be something else. If the Son of God needed boundaries, surely we do too.

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

This connects beautifully to what myths about boundaries have held you back?. Elena, how would you encourage listeners to approach that reflection?

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

Start with curiosity rather than judgment. Notice your patterns without immediately trying to fix them. Ask yourself: Where did I learn this? What was this pattern trying to protect me from? Who modeled this for me? Understanding the origin often softens our self-criticism.

The goal isn't to blame anyone—not your parents, not your church, not yourself. The goal is understanding. With understanding comes choice. And with choice comes freedom.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

And remember, awareness is the first step. You can't change what you won't see. Be gentle with yourself as you look at hard things. This work takes courage. The fact that you're here, listening, engaging—that already shows courage.


[SEGMENT 4: PRACTICAL APPLICATION - 4 minutes]

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

Alright, let's get practical. This week's exercise is specifically designed to help you apply what we've discussed. Elena, walk us through it.

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

Write down every boundary myth you've believed. Next to each, write the truth that counters it. Post this somewhere you'll see it daily. Repetition rewires belief.

Make two columns on a piece of paper. On the left, write every myth about boundaries you've ever believed or been told: "Boundaries are selfish." "Good Christians don't set limits." "If I say no, they won't love me." "It's my job to keep everyone happy."

On the right, write the truth that counters each myth: "Boundaries are essential for real love." "Jesus set boundaries constantly." "People who can't handle my no were only using my yes." "I'm responsible for my actions, not others' feelings."

Post this somewhere you'll see it daily—bathroom mirror, refrigerator, car dashboard. Every day, read through it. Speak it out loud. Repetition is how we rewire belief systems.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

I'd add one thing: don't try to change everything at once. The temptation when you're learning this material is to revolutionize your entire life by next Tuesday. That leads to burnout and discouragement.

Instead, pick one area. Start small. Success builds on success. Make one change, solidify it, then add another. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

That's such wise counsel. Progress over perfection. Consistency over intensity. Small steps in the right direction are still steps.

Here are three additional practices for this week:

**Daily Practice**: Take two minutes each morning to set an intention around boundaries. Before your feet hit the floor, ask yourself: What's one boundary I'll honor today? What's one situation where I need to be alert? This primes your brain to notice opportunities.

**Mid-week Check-in**: Wednesday, take five minutes to assess. How are you doing with the main exercise? What's working? What's hard? What adjustments do you need? Course-correct if necessary—that's not failure, it's wisdom.

**Weekend Reflection**: Before the week ends, journal about your experiences. What did you learn? What surprised you? What will you carry forward? Celebrate any progress, no matter how small. Celebration reinforces behavior.

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

And remember, setbacks are data, not disasters. If you struggle this week—and some of you will—get curious instead of critical. What triggered the struggle? What need were you trying to meet? What might you do differently next time?

Curiosity is more useful than criticism. Always.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

In faith language, there's grace for the journey. You're not expected to be perfect—you're invited to be present. God doesn't require flawless execution. God invites faithful engagement.


[SEGMENT 5: REFLECTION QUESTIONS - 2 minutes]

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

Before we close, I want to leave you with some reflection questions. You might want to pause the podcast here and journal, or simply let these questions sit with you through the week.

This week's reflection focus is: What myths about boundaries have held you back?

Here are four questions to ponder:

**Question One**: What boundary myth has had the most power over you?

Take a breath. Don't rush to answer. Let the question do its work.

**Question Two**: Who taught you that boundaries are selfish? What was their motivation?

Again, no need to have a neat answer. The questions are invitations, not tests.

**Question Three**: Which type of boundary—physical, emotional, time, or energy—needs the most attention?

Notice what comes up. Resistance? Curiosity? Relief?

**Question Four**: How would your life change if you truly believed boundaries were healthy?

Consider journaling about these questions this week.

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

Remember, reflection isn't meant to be comfortable. Good questions should challenge us. If these questions stir something up, that's information worth attending to.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

And hold these questions with grace. You're doing important work. The fact that you're engaging at all is significant.


[SEGMENT 6: CLOSING - 3 minutes]

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

As we wrap up Week 5, I want to leave you with some encouragement.

Every myth you release is space for truth. You're making room for a new story about what boundaries mean and who you're allowed to be.

Next week, we'll explore Boundaries and Self Systems I, covering Tawwab Chapters 5-6, McBride Chapters 1-2. This builds directly on what we've discussed today.

**Your preparation for Week 6:**

Complete the readings: Tawwab Chapters 5-6, McBride Chapters 1-2. If you can only read one thing, prioritize the first reading listed. But if you can engage with all of them, you'll get so much more from our discussion.

Continue this week's practical exercise. The exercises are designed to compound—each week's work prepares you for the next.

Notice what themes from this week show up in your daily life. Awareness is your homework. When you see common boundary myths in action, note it. When you catch yourself in old patterns, note it. When you successfully hold a boundary, note it and celebrate.

Consider discussing this week's content with someone you trust. Shared learning deepens learning. And you might find that others are struggling with similar issues.

[VOICE: Rev. Marcus Thompson]

This has been a rich conversation. I'm grateful for each listener engaging with this material. The work you're doing matters—not just for you, but for everyone your life touches. When leaders become healthier, organizations become healthier. When individuals learn boundaries, families transform.

You're not just doing this for yourself. You're doing it for everyone who will benefit from the more boundaried, more present, more whole version of you. That's a lot of people.

[VOICE: Dr. Elena Rodriguez]

Remember, change takes time. Neural pathways don't rewire overnight. Be patient with yourself. Celebrate progress. Seek support when you need it. 

If you're finding this material brings up a lot for you—old memories, strong emotions, difficult realizations—that's normal. It means the work is working. But it also means you might benefit from additional support. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can walk alongside you.

You're not meant to do this alone. None of us are.

[VOICE: Dr. Sarah Chen]

Thank you for joining us for Week 5 of Healthy Boundaries for Leaders. I'm Dr. Sarah Chen, alongside Rev. Marcus Thompson and Dr. Elena Rodriguez.

Before you go, remember our three takeaways from today:

**First**: Debunking Myths is essential for understanding myths and types of boundaries.

**Second**: This week's practical exercise—do it. Don't just think about it, do it. Application is where transformation happens.

**Third**: Be compassionate with yourself in this work. Growth is rarely linear. Honor your pace.

Until next time, remember: Boundaries aren't barriers to love—they're the architecture of healthy relationship. They're not walls that keep people out—they're doors that let the right things in.

Take care of yourselves, friends. And take care of each other.
